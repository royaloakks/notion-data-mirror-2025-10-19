a series of promotional posters have popped up in numerous locations. The adverts contain the Blink-182 logo as well as the phrase ‚ÄòOne more time‚Ä¶‚Äô, which could be the title of the new album or a single.
According to the¬†Blink-182 Italia fan account¬†on X (formerly known as Twitter), the posters also feature what appear to be song lyrics: ‚ÄúDo I have to die to hear you miss me?/ Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?/ I don‚Äôt want to act like there‚Äôs tomorrow/ I don‚Äôt want to wait to do this one more time.‚Äù
Additionally, a QR code on the ads directs fans to a new ‚Äòstall‚Äô page on the band‚Äôs official website. When clicking through, users are told that the site is currently ‚Äúclosed for maintenance‚Äù as it shows someone cleaning Blink-related graffiti off a tiled wall.
Various classic songs soundtrack the video before a brief snippet of new material eventually plays out.¬†Visit the page here, and see the preview image below.

- **Description**: 1 of 1 album secretly recorded

Once Upon A Time In Shaolin album, 2015. Reportedly recorded in secret over a six year period, this one-of-one album is available in physical form only as a 2 CD package. It first sold to Martin Shkreli for an unspecific sum. Following his conviction for securities fraud, a federal court seized his assets which included the album. In July 2021, the US Department of Justice sold it to non-fungible token collectors PleasrDAO for $4 million to cover Shkreli's debts. As part of the legally binding deal terms of pending the album, the owner of the album cannot commercially exploit the recordings until 2103‚Ä¶ although it can be played at ‚Äòlistening parties‚Äô

a series of promotional posters have popped up in numerous locations. The adverts contain the Blink-182 logo as well as the phrase ‚ÄòOne more time‚Ä¶‚Äô, which could be the title of the new album or a single.
According to the¬†Blink-182 Italia fan account¬†on X (formerly known as Twitter), the posters also feature what appear to be song lyrics: ‚ÄúDo I have to die to hear you miss me?/ Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?/ I don‚Äôt want to act like there‚Äôs tomorrow/ I don‚Äôt want to wait to do this one more time.‚Äù
Additionally, a QR code on the ads directs fans to a new ‚Äòstall‚Äô page on the band‚Äôs official website. When clicking through, users are told that the site is currently ‚Äúclosed for maintenance‚Äù as it shows someone cleaning Blink-related graffiti off a tiled wall.
Various classic songs soundtrack the video before a brief snippet of new material eventually plays out.¬†Visit the page here, and see the preview image below.

He's now a playable character within the endless-runner game, and his latest single, the DJ Khaled and Usher-featuring 'Dientes', will also feature. There's also an environmental angle to the partnership between Balvin and developer Sybo. A third partner, PlanetPlay, is described as a "climate-conscious game marketplace". A portion of sales from in-app purchases of Balvin's character will be donated via PlanetPlay to the Hongera Clean Cookstove Project in Kenya. PlanetPlay will also be selling limited-edition t-shirts based on Balvin, offsetting carbon emissions as they go.

One-off 12‚Äùs planted secretly in record stores globally including Other Music in New York (RIP) and Rough Trade East in London. Each one featured 20 seconds of unique audio of a voice reading out a series numbers along with each individual sleeve featuring what appeared to be a fill-in-the-gaps clue ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî / XXXXXX / ‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù. 
Shows on BBC Radio 1 and NPR played snippets of audio (with no context) revealing more unique numbers to fill in the gaps in the same audio style as that found on the previously located 12‚Äùs. 
The BoC fan blog, ¬†2020k, discovered a YouTube channel called Hell Interface (a past alias of Boards of Canada) using a blank video, but featured an image if you hovered your cursor over the timeline, to link to another video, which featured a new number being read in the same style as the 12‚Äù.
BoC updated their official YouTube playlist moving three Twoism-inspired videos to the top. A user on the BoC unofficial messagboard Twoism¬†spotted that one of the rotating banners on had been altered to feature a strange pattern of text. A user downloaded the .gif banner and opened it in Notepad to reveal a string of code, which led to two private Soundcloud links on what looked to be an official BoC‚Äôs account. Both featured music buried under distortion and when¬†combined, the tracks resembled the snippets already discovered across the world, and included a new number 628315. Copying and pasting part of the code into a hex editor¬†revealed an image, which confirmed the placement of the number. 
Finally an advert on Adult Swim revealed what appeared to be the last part of the six-piece code. 
All of the pieces of the puzzle so far were pieces to reveal the string of numbers to be ‚Äú699742 / 628315 / 717228 / 936557 / ‚Äî‚Äî / 519225‚Äù.

Once Upon A Time In Shaolin album, 2015. Reportedly recorded in secret over a six year period, this one-of-one album is available in physical form only as a 2 CD package. It first sold to Martin Shkreli for an unspecific sum. Following his conviction for securities fraud, a federal court seized his assets which included the album. In July 2021, the US Department of Justice sold it to non-fungible token collectors PleasrDAO for $4 million to cover Shkreli's debts. As part of the legally binding deal terms of pending the album, the owner of the album cannot commercially exploit the recordings until 2103‚Ä¶ although it can be played at ‚Äòlistening parties‚Äô

One-off 12‚Äùs planted secretly in record stores globally including Other Music in New York (RIP) and Rough Trade East in London. Each one featured 20 seconds of unique audio of a voice reading out a series numbers along with each individual sleeve featuring what appeared to be a fill-in-the-gaps clue ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî / XXXXXX / ‚Äî‚Äî / ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù. 
Shows on BBC Radio 1 and NPR played snippets of audio (with no context) revealing more unique numbers to fill in the gaps in the same audio style as that found on the previously located 12‚Äùs. 
The BoC fan blog, ¬†2020k, discovered a YouTube channel called Hell Interface (a past alias of Boards of Canada) using a blank video, but featured an image if you hovered your cursor over the timeline, to link to another video, which featured a new number being read in the same style as the 12‚Äù.
BoC updated their official YouTube playlist moving three Twoism-inspired videos to the top. A user on the BoC unofficial messagboard Twoism¬†spotted that one of the rotating banners on had been altered to feature a strange pattern of text. A user downloaded the .gif banner and opened it in Notepad to reveal a string of code, which led to two private Soundcloud links on what looked to be an official BoC‚Äôs account. Both featured music buried under distortion and when¬†combined, the tracks resembled the snippets already discovered across the world, and included a new number 628315. Copying and pasting part of the code into a hex editor¬†revealed an image, which confirmed the placement of the number. 
Finally an advert on Adult Swim revealed what appeared to be the last part of the six-piece code. 
All of the pieces of the puzzle so far were pieces to reveal the string of numbers to be ‚Äú699742 / 628315 / 717228 / 936557 / ‚Äî‚Äî / 519225‚Äù.
There was one piece of the code still remaining to be located, eventually it formulated a password:¬†699742628315717228936557813386519225, which took you to a promo video for the album.
Search FACT Mag and the 2020K blog for a more detailed map of the information and how it rolled out.

Fans don't just enter an email address to try to win tickets though: they have to¬†complete three missions on the 'LDN Calling' site, which are being dropped one a day. The first involves perusing footage of some of the new game's environments to spot numbers, which when put together will reveal the date of the concert. The game itself comes out on¬†10 November, which neatly is the same day the new mixtape from Chase & Status, '2 Ruff, Vol. 1', comes out.

What‚Äôs the most critical that can be said?
A simple approach to learning how to solicit and receive feedback: Begin by showing a well-meaning peer someone else‚Äôs novel, painting, design or business plan‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt need unwarranted criticism or simple reassurance. In fact, we need someone who understands genre and has the insight to share what they know in a way we can use.

### Nathan Baugh

- Language: JRR Tolkien invented 15 languages for his books. Create phrases that become so common for your audience they associate them with you or your brand. It‚Äôs like inside jokes ‚Äì shared lingo that only makes sense in your world.
  - iMessage = Apple: Apple owns the ‚Äòi‚Äô in front of its products. No other brand can use that without Apple first coming to mind.
  - wingardium leviosa = Harry Potter: I went to a wedding where the couple exited through everyone holding sparklers. I heard at least five people say this Latin-derived hodgepodge JK Rowling invented 20 years ago. That‚Äôs powerful.
- Rituals: Tolkien gave each of the different cultures he created their own customs and rituals. People function in this way. Shared rituals make us feel part of a group.
  - Crumbl Cookies: Each week, Crumbl releases a new lineup of six cookies to replace last week‚Äôs lineup. This creates a sense of anticipation (Crumbl fans look forward to the drop), a sense of urgency (if you don‚Äôt buy that kind of cookie this week, you may never again have the chance), and a sense of togetherness (the launch posts get hundreds of thousands of likes on IG and TikTok).
  The Story
  1. Call To Adventure: The Hero ‚Äî appeal to deeply held beliefs about the human condition, like drive for success and persistence through adversity
  1. Victory Over Crisis: The Hero‚Äôs struggle to overcome adversity, fighting against their foes, competitors, detractors ‚Äî the wise sage guides them through. First the Hero resists it (It‚Äôs not for me), but finally they heed the call for adventure and they face their fears (foes, competitors, detractors), the hero survives and triumphs.
  1. Transformation: The Hero‚Äôs story doesn‚Äôt end with triumph, they must be transformed long-term. Look to the enduring benefits of The Hero and the emotions they inspire in people.
  ### Robert McKee

  The Purpose-Told Story: 8 Stages
  1. The Targets
    Before considering our story, we must understand our:
    - Target Audience: who we‚Äôre talking to
    - Target Need: what problem they have that we can solve
    - Target Action: What we want them to do
    Without defining these three we‚Äôre guessing
  1. Subject Matter
    The constraints and subjects that make up our story:
    - Core Value: the value our brand couldn‚Äôt exist without
    - Protagonist: the hero our audience empathises with
    - Setting: society, time and place
  1. The Inciting Incident
    Launch the story by throwing the protagonists story out of whack
    Our goal is two-fold:
    - Grab your audience‚Äôs attention 
    - Propel the protagonist to action
    ‚Äúfine storytellers seek out the negative side of life‚Äù
  1. The Object of Desire
    An unfulfilled need the protagonist feels the need to get their life back on track.
    That happens to be fulfilled by our product / service
    the most compelling objects come with a high price tag, a high price to entry.
  1. First Action
    The tactical choice the protagonist makes to re-balance their life.
    This cannot succeed. That‚Äôd be too easy.
    Introduce antagonists ‚Äì anything keeping the protagonist from the object of desire
  1. The First Reaction
    The reaction to the First Action should be different or more powerful than expected. 
    This gap in expectation vs reality leaves space for the protagonist to gain insight.
    Two key aspects:
    - Violation of expectations
    - Turning points
  1. Crisis Choice
    The moment of truth ‚Äì this final action must be more risky than the first.
    It‚Äôs now or never.
    The protagonist will either re-balance their life or remain in chaos.
  1. Climatic Reaction
    The protagonist gets their life back on track.
    Neuroscientists find the brain‚Äôs response to a good story‚Äôs climax is a few seconds of heightened memory.
    McKee recommends putting your logo right after the climax to take advantage of this. 
  Start With The End ‚Äì the audience, their problem and the desired action.
  Then Figure Out The Beginning ‚Äì the event to trigger the story.
  Lastly ‚Äì build the narrative arc to connect the beginning to end

What is your song about? Love and heartbreak? How are you going to tell me that story in a way I‚Äôve never heard before? In a way I didn‚Äôt know I needed to hear it? What‚Äôs your use of metaphor that paints the picture we‚Äôve seen a thousand times?
The Extra 20%
What‚Äôs the extra on top? What‚Äôs the 20% and then 10%.
20% is the extra that only the most dedicated fans get. The day ones.
10% is the standard we should always apply that is going to be the thing people talk about.

# üí° Fan-Centric Artist Branding

Customer-Based Brand Equity (Keller, 1993)
- Level 1: Make the artist stand out.¬†The first step is to create brand awareness. People should be able to recognise and identify the artist. This step is harder than it may seem: Most brands never move further from this step.
- Level 2: Build the artist‚Äôs image.¬†Next, artists should know and communicate what they mean to fans and what the artist‚Äôs brand stands for. The¬†brand‚Äôs benefits¬†come to mind here.
- Level 3: Manage the fan‚Äôs judgements and feelings.¬†Then, artists should understand how they make fans feel and how fans judge them. This should be aligned with the artist‚Äôs brand positioning and the main associations they focus on in their marketing strategy.
- Level 4: Build strong emotional connections with fans.¬†Finally, when fans feel deeply connected with the artist's brand, artists should invest in a community ecosystem where fans could engage in meaningful interactions between the artist and their fans and between fans.
# üí° The Brand Knowledge Model

Functional benefits¬†relate to the brand‚Äôs problem-solving or problem-removal capabilities. They represent the intrinsic advantages of consuming the brand. For example:
- I listen to [artist brand] because it helps me focus.
- I listen to music to stimulate me during my workout.
Experiential benefits¬†or emotional benefits relate to what it feels like when using the brand. For example:
- Listening to [artist brand] makes me feel happy/sad.
- When I see [artist brand] on Instagram I feel empowered.
Symbolic benefits¬†relate to the brand‚Äôs extrinsic, non-product-related advantages, such as social approval and self-expression. Most artist brand positioning focuses on this. For example:
- I wear a [artist brand] t-shirt to show that I belong to this fan base.
- I post this music on my stories to show I‚Äôm always the first with new music.
Analysing the symbolic benefits of a brand gives information about a fan‚Äôs identity and the niche, scene and/or community they surround themselves with.

## üí° Fanbases Making A Social Impact ‚Äì PACT Model (Tory Fairies)

1. Product: Activate your community to share or donate your¬†product or service. For decades, airlines have been leveraging this model by empowering travelers to¬†donate their frequent flier miles¬†to organizations like Make-A-Wish. Retailer Madewell recently launched a program where loyal customers¬†can drop off pre-worn jeans at a local store to be repurposed into housing insulation, and they reward their customers‚Äô good deeds with a $20 store credit.
1. Advocacy: Activate your community‚Äôs¬†collective voice¬†to draw attention to the issue areas your company impact strategy is championing. Call on them to sign petitions, circulate social media campaigns, and show up for change. Bobbie baby formula, a former¬†client¬†of mine, activated their community of parents to¬†call their representatives to urge them to pass legislation to combat the Black maternal mortality crisis¬†and rallied parents to march at the Capitol to demand legislative reform after 2022‚Äôs infant formula crisis.
1. Contributions: Activating your community to¬†give funds¬†is one of the most common ways companies engage, and when done right, can be an effective way to double your organization's impact. Clearly communicate your company‚Äôs skin in the game through a match or corporate contribution, and work together toward a time-bound, right-sized goal (whether that‚Äôs raising $1k or $10M). You‚Äôre likely to hear a classic example of this type of campaign on your daily commute when your local public radio station is doing a fund drive (‚ÄúIf callers help us reach our goal of raising $1,000 in the next hour, a local partner will match your effort, dollar for dollar!‚Äù).
1. Time¬†&¬†skills: Activating your community‚Äôs¬†time¬†can be as simple as inviting them to roll up their sleeves and volunteer alongside your employees for a service project. To tap further into the skills your community has to offer, ask if they have a unique skill they can offer your nonprofit partners. LinkedIn leverages its technology to make it easy for¬†community members to indicate their willingness to join nonprofit boards.
Artist Application
- Product¬†- Activate fans to donate an artist‚Äôs work. For example, give fans the opportunity to buy an extra ticket for a show and donate these tickets to fans with a lower income or refugees.

UK Rap as a genre and community of fans
### Define Your Research Question

Clearly articulate what you want to learn or investigate through your Netnography. What aspects of the online space do you find intriguing or relevant to your interests in music, marketing, or psychology?
What is driving music discovery in UK Rap?
What are the prominent brands (clothing, footwear, tech, social) that a close affinity within UK Rap?

- **Type**: Framework
- **Status**: Draft
- **Stage**: Define / Design

Acquisition; Activation; Retention; Revenue; Referral
- Acquisition: how do people discover you & your music, so Discovery.
- Activation: how do people engage with you, so Engagement.
- Retention: how will people show repeat engagement over time?
- Revenue: where do people spend money directly on you? Merch, tickets?
- Referral: how do people tell others about you? Social, word of mouth?
### Fan Journey Framework

Step One: Get discovered by new fans
write down all the likely places people might discover your music, be they friend recommendations (through which medium?), recommendation engines (what platforms?), social media e.g. through people sharing your posts, radio airplay (where?), playlists (which? platform?), etc. Try to identify the most important ones today that will still be important 6 months from now.
Step Two: Engage acquired fans
For the sake of this example fan journey, let‚Äôs say the next step from Discovery is that people Google you on their way to Engagement. What do they Google? If they‚Äôve seen you in a playlist, they might Google your name. If they heard your latest song on the radio, your lyrics or a misspelling of your name. Try it out and see what the search results are like. Will they have to type ‚Äúmusic‚Äù next to your name to find you as an artist? What are the first results? Note down what you‚Äôd ideally like to see here.
A very common Google search results page order for more established artists is: a carousel of videos at the top, then Wikipedia, then your YouTube channel, then your homepage.
If the video carousel is showing, click the top left video. If it‚Äôs not, go to your most viewed YouTube video, which is usually the one in these results. The very first result on search pages tends to get the most traffic. It should now be clear for people how they can follow you on YouTube as well as on another platform, such as Instagram. If not, take notes, so you can improve this.
Next, click your Instagram link from the video description. Landing on your Instagram profile, be super critical: how enticing is it? Is it clear to people what they get when they follow you? Does it invite people to engage?
### Step Three: Retain existing fans

Once people follow you, recurring engagement (aka retention) will depend on your content calendar. Keep this goal in mind when working on your schedule.

RUMBLE CREATIVE BRIEF
- What is the objective of the piece?
What does the communication aim to achieve? Are there hard objectives? Like generating leads? Or driving sales? Is there a specific benchmark that needs to be achieved? Like achieving a 20% response rate? Or are the objectives softer? Announcing a new product for instance? Whatever the objective, make it concrete and specific. Who are you talking to?
Paint a picture of the target audience. Their needs, desires and wants. As well as the things they don't like, don't care for or don't want.
- What do they currently think about your product or service?
Do they like it? Trust it? Prefer it over other, similar offerings? Or do they currently have issues with the product? Barriers that stop them from buying it?
- What do you want them to think?
What mind shift do you want to create? What transformation? What words would you like to hear from the customer's mouth after they have read our communication?
- What features and benefits do we want the audience to hear about?
What specifics about our product or service will create interest, create resonance and create desire?
- What do you want our audience to do?
Is a response required from the communication? Do you want people to order from you? Or do you want to drive them to a physical location? An online store perhaps? Do you want them to download a voucher? Or are you simply writing to them to say thank you for their support?
Perhaps you want to convey a brand message?
- What's the single most important promise you are making?
There may be many messages you want to get across in your communication. But you need to choose the most important one. The one that is going to solicit the most impactful response. Please avoid using 'and' in your promise. The use of the word means there are two separate thoughts in your promise.
- Why should they believe this?
Your promise should be supported by facts, benefits and features. Work out what they are and list them in order of importance.
- What mandatories need to be included in the communication?
What are the messages, images, logos, assets and legal disclaimers that need to be included?
To conduct a cultural study, consider these key observations:
1. Social Customs: Observe daily rituals, greetings, and social interactions within the community.
1. Language and Communication: Analyze language nuances, verbal and non-verbal communication, and any unique expressions or idioms.
1. Traditions and Celebrations: Explore local festivities, holidays, and traditional ceremonies to understand their cultural significance.
1. Arts and Entertainment: Examine local arts, music, dance, and entertainment forms as expressions of cultural identity.
1. Cuisine and Eating Habits: Study local food customs, traditional dishes, and the role of meals in social contexts.
1. Beliefs and Values: Understand the community's religious beliefs, moral values, and any guiding principles shaping their worldview.
1. Clothing and Fashion: Note traditional attire and how it reflects cultural norms, identity, and societal roles.
1. Architecture and Urban Planning: Analyze the design of buildings, public spaces, and infrastructure, as they often reflect cultural preferences.
1. Historical Context: Consider historical events and their impact on the community's identity, values, and traditions.
1. Technology and Innovation: Explore how technology is integrated into daily life and whether it influences cultural practices.
Remember to engage with the community, ask open-ended questions, and approach the study with cultural sensitivity. It's crucial to adapt your methods based on the specific context of the culture you're studying.
For a cultural study of UK rap, apply the principles as follows:
1. Lyrics and Language: Analyze the lyrics for slang, regional accents, and cultural references, reflecting the linguistic diversity within the UK rap scene.
1. Live Performances and Events: Attend concerts and events to observe the audience, fashion trends, and the overall atmosphere surrounding UK rap performances.
1. Artistic Expression: Explore the visual aspects of album covers, music videos, and promotional materials to understand how artists express their cultural identity.
1. Collaborations and Features: Examine collaborations between UK rap artists and other musicians, identifying cross-genre influences that contribute to the cultural tapestry.
1. Social Media and Online Communities: Study how UK rap artists engage with fans on social media platforms, forums, and online communities, reflecting the digital influence on cultural expression.
1. Fashion and Style: Observe the fashion choices of UK rap artists, considering how clothing and style contribute to their individual and collective cultural identity.
1. Narratives and Storytelling: Analyze the narratives within UK rap songs, exploring themes of identity, social issues, and cultural pride.
1. Local Influences: Investigate how regional influences shape the sound and themes of UK rap, acknowledging the diversity within the country.
1. Historical Roots: Understand the historical context that has influenced the evolution of UK rap, considering socio-political factors and the genre's roots in the UK's multicultural landscape.
1. Technological Innovation: Explore how technology, especially social media and streaming platforms, has impacted the production, distribution, and reception of UK rap music.

### Word of Mouth

I believe our fans and followers are those which will help us acquire new fans. If there‚Äôs a group of 10 friends and 6 of them are fans, the greatest opportunity we have of converting those other 4 are the 6 fans already bought in. Even then let‚Äôs apply a 20% variance, we can‚Äôt ever convert everyone, so we only need to win over another two of the friends. 6 vs 2 feels like good odds. Essentially what we‚Äôre saying is Word of Mouth, as un-revolutionary as that concept sounds. 
‚ÄúPeople don't believe what you tell them. They rarely believe what you show them. They often believe what their friends tell them. They always believe what they tell themselves.‚Äù -Seth Godin
I believe art gives a voice to the voiceless. It allows us to express ourselves in ways we find difficult. To tell someone how we feel. When you find two or more people who come together because of music in sharing a voice then that‚Äôs powerful. Underdog stories that speak truth to power, communicate love when we can‚Äôt say it ourselves, it gives strength. It pushes up against the accepted way of doing things, it‚Äôs non-conformist, it makes our world more colourful and rich. It inspires conversation and debate, one tiny little song can literally change the course of someone‚Äôs life. 
If I can play a small part in that journey by playing around with imaginative and creative ideas that help contextualise and communicate an artist and song to people then that brings me immense fulfilment. 
Starting with what you believe is a helpful precursor to finding out your WHY. 
Art is enduring - institutions, money, laws, power, these have and will continue to change, yet we look at a picture or hear a song that has continued to be appreciated across generations of these changes. 
Yasiin Bey quote 
But it can be enduring on a personal level. It‚Äôs transformative - the emotional attachment we form with a 3 minute piece of music can make us feel 18 again. It brings us back to last summer or 25 summers ago. The people we were with the the places we‚Äôve been. Or the places it will take us - the confidence it gives us to see what world is possible, for us and for everyone.

When selling, the temptation is to focus on the mushroom‚Äîtalk about its merits, features, and attributes. But this is what everyone does, so there‚Äôs no alpha there. You have to zig when they zag! You‚Äôre much better off focusing on Big Mario‚Äîthe person that your potential customer will become after your product or service:
Superpowers they will suddenly possess.
Pains they will avoid.
Wealth they will accumulate.
Status they will garner.

# üéØStreaming Growth Framework

How to turn fan intent into sustained algorithmic momentum
## üîπ TIER 1: Fan Intent Signals

Most Direct Impact
These are the strongest early predictors of algorithmic growth and segment conversion ‚Äî especially when stacked in Week 1.
Ref: üìå Hands Up In The Sky had low total listeners but high intent ratios ‚Äî now showing algorithmic lift.
## üîπ TIER 2: Downstream Engagement Surfaces

Reinforcement Layer
These don‚Äôt create intent ‚Äî they amplify and retain it.
Ref: üìå Losing Control had 45‚Äì50% of streams from Collection + Search.
## üîπ TIER 3: Initial Exposure Channels

Enablers, Not Drivers
These boost visibility, but don‚Äôt trigger long-term growth unless paired with intent signals.
Ref: üìå Supersonic had 46% editorial share but just 6.5% Save Rate ‚Äî reach without retention.
## üîπ TIER 4: Creative / Marketing Execution

Levers to Trigger Tier 1 & 2 Signals
These actions influence the signals that matter ‚Äî through targeting, messaging, and creative decisions.
## üß† Synthesised Insight: What Drives the Flywheel

### Ideal Track Journey

1. Reach
  Editorial, TikTok, fanbase, spark ads and content boosts
  ‚Üì
1. Save, Add, Replay
  High per-listener engagement in Week 1
  ‚Üì
1. Collection & Search
  Listeners actively returning
  ‚Üì
1. Algorithmic Pickup
  Spotify responds in Week 2+
  ‚Üì
1. Segment Growth
  Super / Moderate listeners increase
  ‚Üì
1. Looped Exposure
  Algorithm + fandom reinforce each other
## üß≠¬†Expanded Ideal Track Journey

A high-performing song doesn‚Äôt just go viral ‚Äî it follows a sequence where fan behaviour trains the algorithm.
### 1. Initial Reach (Pre-Release + Week 1)

The moment people first hear the track ‚Äî before Spotify‚Äôs algorithm gets involved.
Includes:
- Spotify Editorial Playlists (e.g. New Music Friday, New Dance)
- TikTok virality (organic or Spark Ads)
- Fanbase marketing (presaves, Discord campaigns, email newsletters, direct messages)
- Influencer co-signs or reposts
- Journalistic press (Dazed, Resident Advisor, etc.) ‚Äî indirect but can spark discovery
- Radio premieres / SoundCloud drops / YouTube trailers
Key Goal:
Drive targeted reach to high-intent listeners likely to save, replay, or add the track ‚Äî not just passive exposure.
> ‚ùå Reach without engagement = wasted discovery

> ‚úÖ Reach + Save/Add/Replay = algorithm-ready audience

### 2. Early Intent Signals (Week 1‚Äì2)

This is when Spotify starts listening to listener behaviour.
Signals that matter most:
- Saves (volume)
- Playlist Adds
- Replay Ratio (Streams : Listeners)
- Save-to-Listener %
- Add-to-Listener %
These signals feed Spotify‚Äôs relevance models (esp. on release radar and daily mix inclusion). High volume + high ratios = greenlight for algorithmic promotion.
> üìå

  Losing Control
### 3. Downstream Engagement Surfaces (Week 2+)

How listeners behave when they return to the track organically.
Key surfaces:
- Collection Streams (from their saved library)
- Search Streams (actively looking for the track again)
- Play Queue / Repeat Plays
These are some of the most predictive signals of long-tail retention and algorithmic eligibility for Discover Weekly, On Repeat, Your Top Songs, etc.
> üìå Tracks with strong Collection/Search behaviour tend to enter long-tail algorithmic loops.

### 4. Algorithmic Pickup (Week 2‚Äì3)

If fan behaviour is strong, Spotify responds by pushing the track algorithmically.
Algorithms likely activated:
- Discover Weekly
- Radio
- On Repeat
- Daily Mixes
- Genre/Contextual Autoplay
Expect uplift in:
- Algorithmic stream count
- Algorithmic share (% of total)
- Repeat listener conversion (Moderate ‚Üí Super)
> üìà Both

  Losing Control
  Hands Up
### 5. Segment Deepening (Week 3‚Äì4)

Your fanbase is now stratifying into Super, Moderate, and Light listeners.
Key conversions to track:
- Growth in Super listeners
- Reduction in Light % (means retention is working)
- Share of total streams from Collection + Autoplay
- Active engagement on artist profile or future releases
This is the foundation for:
- Ticketing
- Merch conversion
- Future release anticipation
### 6. Recirculation via Fandom or Algorithm (Week 4+)

The track either fades, or loops back into circulation.
Triggers:
- New influencer moment / viral usage


### Streaming Data Principles
- **Theme / Topic**: Research
- **Type**: Playbook
- **Status**: Canonical
- **Stage**: Discover

# üéØ Streaming Data Principles

A strategic playbook for understanding and improving streaming performance across releases.
These principles are drawn from Marlon Hoffstadt‚Äôs catalogue but designed as a diagnostic lens for other artists. Benchmarks should be calibrated by genre, scale, and audience maturity.
## üß† Core Framework: The 3S Flywheel

A repeatable model for organic streaming growth:
Save ‚Üí Replay ‚Üí Collection ‚Üí Algorithmic Uplift
Spotify interprets these signals as:
- Save = intent to revisit
- Replay Ratio = reinforced interest
- Collection/Search = emotional commitment
- Together, they train Spotify‚Äôs algorithm to expand reach
## üîç Key Correlation Insights

Save Rate (%)
- Moderately correlated with Replay Ratio (+0.45)
- Strongly negatively correlated with Editorial Streams (‚Äì0.82), Streams (‚Äì0.53), and Listeners (‚Äì0.67)
  Conclusion: Save Rate = quality per listener, not scale. High exposure often lowers Save Rate, while fan-driven releases trend higher.
Stream-to-Listener Ratio (Replay Ratio)
- Correlates positively with Save Rate (+0.45), Playlist Adds (+0.36), Algorithmic Streams (+0.25)
  Conclusion: Replay is the clearest proxy for love. Tracks above 2.0x see stronger Week 2 algorithmic growth.
Playlist Adds & Saves (Volume)
- Most predictive of Week 2 Algo: Adds (r = +0.93), Saves (r = +0.92)
- Strong correlation with Listener Segment conversion: Save-to-Listener % (+0.96), Playlist-to-Listener % (+0.97)
  Conclusion: Raw Saves/Adds = scale predictors. Per-listener ratios = depth predictors.
Collection Streams
- Strong correlation with total saves (+0.84), weak correlation with Save Rate (+0.04)
  Conclusion: Raw save volume drives Collection use. Collection = intent activated.
Super Listener % (Standalone)
- Strongly correlated with Week 2 Algo Growth:
  - Losing Control & Hands ‚â•5% ‚Üí uplift
  - Supersonic & Daddy‚Äôs ‚â§3% ‚Üí no uplift
- Correlates with Save %, Playlist %, Replay Ratio
  Conclusion: Super Listener % is the emotional truth metric. If core fans don‚Äôt care, the algorithm won‚Äôt push further.
The Editorial Trade-Off
- Editorial negatively correlates with Save Rate (‚Äì0.82), Replay Ratio (‚Äì0.29), Super % (‚Äì0.76)
  Conclusion: Editorial = reach, not intent. Ideal balance: Editorial < Algo + Collection.
## üß† Fan Behaviour Loops

Fan Experience A: Replay ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Collection ‚Üí Return
‚Üí Spotify sees this as real-time engagement stacking
Fan Experience B: Save ‚Üí Return ‚Üí Replay ‚Üí Add to Playlist
‚Üí Spotify sees this as proactive fandom
These loops illustrate how Save, Replay, and Collection stack to trigger Week 2 uplift.
## üîÅ The Flywheel in Action: Case Studies

üî• Losing Control
- Week 1 Saves: 79.5K
- Replay Ratio: 2.31x
- Collection Share: 27.4%
- Week 2 Algo: 528K (+63%)
- Editorial Share: <17%
  Outcome: Strongest performer across all metrics.
üî• Hands Up In The Sky
- Save Rate: 16.4%
- Replay Ratio: 2.29x
- Collection Share: 26.7%
- Week 2 Algo: 51K (+56%)
  Outcome: Lower scale but high per-listener intent = long-tail uplift.
‚ö†Ô∏è Supersonic / Daddy‚Äôs In The Club
- Despite high saves & adds, intent was diluted (low Save Rate, Replay, Super %) 
- Both declined algorithmically in Week 2
## üéØ Strategic Takeaways

1. Activate core fans first
  Super Listener % is the most decisive metric ‚Äî without early fan love, Week 2 algorithmic growth won‚Äôt happen.
1. Push for replay, not just reach
  Content and campaigns should drive repeat listening (Replay Ratio ‚â•2.0x) rather than one-off streams.
1. Make Saves and Adds work harder
  Raw volume unlocks scale, but only if fans return. Pair presaves with tactics that convert into Collection use and replays.
1. Balance exposure with engagement
  Editorial boosts visibility, but Spotify responds more strongly to Collection + Algorithmic streams. Don‚Äôt let passive reach drown out intent.
1. Use paid boosts where intent is high but reach is low
  Spark Ads or targeted pushes are most efficient on tracks with strong Save/Replay signals but modest audience size.
## ‚úÖ Ideal Week 1 Benchmarks

## ‚úçÔ∏è Case Study: Marlon Hoffstadt

## üîÅ¬† Marlon Hoffstadt ‚Äì Week 2 Algorithmic Streams

## üìà¬†Marlon Hoffstadt ‚Äì Losing Control Week 1

## üìà Marlon Hoffstadt ‚Äì Hands Up In The Sky Week 1

## üìâ Wk 1 vs Wk 2 ‚Äî¬†Daddy‚Äôs In The Club

## üìâ Wk 1 vs Wk 2 ‚Äî¬†Supersonic

## üìâ Marlon Hoffstadt ‚Äì Supersonic & Daddy‚Äôs In The Club (Week 1)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Supersonic / Daddy‚Äôs In The Club

- Despite strong raw saves and playlist adds, intent was diluted (low Save Rate, Replay Ratio, Super %).
- Both tracks leaned heavily on editorial and lacked depth of fan activation.
- Result: algorithmic streams fell away in Week 2, showing scale without commitment cannot sustain growth.

  Questions:
  - Who handles merch? Is there a Shopify?
  - Do Platoon have any physical rights to the previous EPs? 2x 12‚Äù EP release of Bluff and Babylon IX
  - Joy Orbison collab
  - US rapper collabs
  - Album pencilled for 2024, new song this year
  - Play for tips ‚Äì was there any discussion previously
  - Cub night: any more planned, branding?
  To Do:
  - Platform Access: Amazon, Bands In Town
  - Bandcamp: setup profile and upload previous EPs (Platoon or self upload?)
  - 
  Ideas: carnival set. Specific type of Dj set Or mix - ASMR or ambient. 
  Reimagining of an album (Bullion). 
  Roblox Spotify partnership. 
  Twitch. Web3 / NFT. 
  Curation. 
  Record shopping - make a mix from selections. 
  Mixes to go live on Apple Music. 
  Spotify Radar. Apple danceXL playlist cover.
  Apple Music 1 show. Radio 1 Residency. Rinse mix. 
  Yun√®verse - what would be in it that‚Äôs reflective of the more introverted world of making music and experiencing music? 
  Artwork is indicative of a metaverse / sci-fi universe - what‚Äôs a graphic interpretation of yun√® like Peggy Gou? It keeps yun√® front and centre, maintains a future element but not overly abstract. 
  Artwork from forward thinking AI creatives, using Midjourney for example (Uncanny?).

  Bluff : Music to wind down and wind up, an extension of yourself 
  Being performative, putting on a tougher front that girls have to do and something she‚Äôs always done
  > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for people to commit to things now, because you‚Äôre constantly aware that there might be a better version. People sometimes get so connected to an online picture of themselves that their real self couldn‚Äôt match up to‚Ä¶ There are all kinds of things that disconnect you from certain parts of reality‚Äù

  Likes being on her own, comfortable with the isolation, not having to feel like you‚Äôre pleasing everyone on the group 
  did developing as an artist throughout the pandemic influence a more introverted take on dance music?
  > I actually felt the pandemic really helped me! I was never able to spend so much time figuring out sonically what I was and finally had the chance to, under very bizarre circumstances. I did have a lot of teenage angst going on though, just missing out on my ‚Äòprime time‚Äô, though looking back I‚Äôm pretty grateful because my life‚Äôs definitely improved a lot on the other side of the pandemic.

  Tries to keep lyrics ambiguous to keep them open to interpretation 
  Wants gigs to be a safe and relaxed place for people to be themselves, to enjoy and discover new music, no clout chasing 
  Never been a big partier, always associates club culture with danger. Historically too much about getting dressed up and getting drunk. Prefers the more collective element of going out, wants spaces to collaborate in. 
   
  > I always want to stay quite retrospective on music, and I don‚Äôt want it to be something that‚Äôs always about me specifically. And never getting too in your own ego. So far I‚Äôve done pretty well ‚Äì ego brushing doesn‚Äôt really work for me. I want to keep on that. I just don‚Äôt want to become a proper diva

  yun√®verse - avatars 
  > Has releasing music under a moniker helped you navigate that transition and separate both of those sides of you?

  > I don‚Äôt really see myself as a separate thing to yun√® pinku, but it helps you tap into parts [of yourself] that you wouldn‚Äôt normally be.¬†I wouldn‚Äôt normally be the person on stage, I would naturally be around that rather than in the middle. But if I‚Äôm yun√® pinku today, I can go out and be that version 

  Safe spaces, route to and from clubs
  > I‚Äôve never been a massive partier, really. But I think that was more because I kind of always associated clubbing and stuff with like, you‚Äôre putting yourself in danger

  Daytime prod / collab meet ups ahead of shows
  > But I do like the fact there‚Äôs much more independent collectives putting on events now, and opening space for more creatives to all meet each other and potentially collaborate. It‚Äôs definitely developing in a positive direction

The best decks tackle the following [Ref]
### ‚Äî Follow a proven structure ‚Äî

The best decks tackle the following:
‚Üí Company purpose
‚Üí Problem
‚Üí Solution
‚Üí Team
‚Üí Product
‚Üí Biz Model
‚Üí Market/TAM
‚Üí Financials
‚Üí Competitors
The rest of the tips in the thread help you take these sections to the next level.
### ‚Äî Declare an enemy ‚Äî

You want to create common ground immediately in a pitch.
Don't make it "Your Company vs The Investors".
Make it "All of Us vs The Problem".
Put the investors on your side ASAP.
E.g. The common enemy for Tesla is fossil fuels.
### ‚Äî Clarify the problem ‚Äî

No one will invest without understanding the real problem you solve.
You have to give clarity on:
‚Üí What the problem is
‚Üí Who it affects
‚Üí What current solutions exist
‚Üí Why those solutions are failing
Then explain why you're the best at solving it
"I couldn't find a solution for X issue so I created Y"
Having a personal problem you are trying to solve makes you the customer.
### ‚Äî Accentuate your social proof ‚Äî

If you have:
‚Üí High User Engagement
‚Üí Product Market Fit
‚Üí A dynamic team
‚Üí Proven sales
Highlight this in your deck.
Investors want to know you have momentum and opportunities outside of their investment.
### ‚Äî Sell the benefits ‚Äî

There will be a time to showcase your features.
Investors want to know the benefits your product brings to the market.
These benefits highlight the real opportunity.
e.g. Figure: no more 8 hour days & high attrition, robots can work 20 hours a day.
### ‚Äî Talk long-term ‚Äî

Investors need to know that this is a 10-year (minimum) project for you and your team.
Commit by showing your massive plans, broken down by milestones.
E.g. Year 1: we will accomplish X, Year 5: we will accomplish Y, etc.
### ‚Äî Give succinct data ‚Äî

Have every bit of data in your back pocket, but only show the key notes.
If you show everything, none of it will bear weight in the pitch.
If you show the most important points, it will stick in investors' minds.
Pro Tip: Bring a pitch deck to meetings with an extended Appendix.
The Appendix includes answers to every possible question you might encounter.
Over time as you field new questions, add them to the Appendix.
### ‚Äî Customize your format ‚Äî

Meeting with Sequoia? They have a recommended format.

Chatting with First Round? They could have a different pitch deck preference.

Research if the Partner has a recommended deck format, and use it.

They're telling you how they think. Align with them
### ‚Äî Talk openly about risk ‚Äî

Investors know that every opportunity is risky.
You aren't going to trick them into thinking otherwise.
But you can show that you:
‚Üí Have thought your idea through
‚Üí Believe you will overcome the risks
‚Üí Are realistic (enough) about your company

- EP with Ghetts:
  - Where can you pop up impulsively and unexpectedly?
  - Low-key high value and credit visibility:
    - Benji B interview to launch (Benji a big Ghetts fan)
    - Benji pro-Palestine so could help soften the narrative around Stormzy and the deleting posts prior to McDonalds collab
- Problems:
  - What does Stormzy perceive to the be the obstacles to overcome?
  - Any narratives that he wants to correct?
  - What narratives to lead with?
- Objectives:
  - For the Ghetts EP

        <div class="content-body">### Primal Branding
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2006
- **Author**: Patrick Hanlon

Primal branding is about delivering the primal code. It is a construct of seven assets that help manage the intangibles of your brand. Those seven assets are: "the creation story"; "the creed"; "the icons"; "the rituals"; "the pagans"; "the sacred words"; and "the leader." Together, these pieces of primal code construct a belief system. P6
Once you look at a brand as a belief system, it automatically gains all the advantages that enterprise strives for: trust, vibrancy, relevance, a sense of values, community, leadership, vision, empathy, commitment, and more. With the seven pieces of primal code in place you have created a belief system and products and services that people can believe in. P7
Believing is belonging. When you are able to create brands that people believe in, you also create groups of people who feel that they belong. This sense of community is at the center of psychologist Abraham Maslow's famous hierarchy of human needs. Whether you belong to a Masai tribe or you're a New Yorker, whether you're a baseball nut, a computer geek, a shopaholic, a marathon runner, a foodie, tekkie, biker, trekker, or triathelete, it is an essential human truth that we all want to belong to something that is larger than ourselves.
That community can surround a product or service, a personality, a social or political cause, or a civic community. P7
Part of the reason that companies like Diageo, Altria, AOL Time Warner, and others do not resonate is that, while we can comprehend the marketplace advantages, they have never adequately explained why they exist. Because we do not understand, those companies lack meaning. One conglomerate company that tried to resonate and failed a decade ago was Beatrice Foods. Their failure was not because they tried, but because they did not know how to use the elements of the primal code, beginning with a creation story. Sticking to traditional advertising and spending millions of advertising dollars propelling its product line and logo sting, the viewer still had no clear idea of Beatrice or its purpose. More important, we did not care. P19
What you believe in, what you want others to believe about you, what the mission is, are not easy statements to make. Imagine the United States of America brand without its Declaration of Independence, its Bill of Rights, or the Pledge of Allegiance. Google provides unbiased, accurate, and free information to the public. The world ecology movement's creed is to save the planet (and ourselves). P20
Icons are quick concentrations of meaning that cause your brand identity and brand values to spontaneously resonate. The Nike swoosh. The Apple start-up "bong." The sound of the Pentium gliss. The smell of Cinnabons, the American flag, the Coke bottle, the Absolut bottle, the Beatles's mop hair, the rock group Kiss's make-up, the Budweiser Clyesdales, the Tide package, the national anthem. Whether the icons are visual, sound bites, smell, or some other form, they are sensory imprints that instantly summon the brand essence. And we recognize these icons early on. When my daughter Devin was just eighteen months old, she would point out the McDonald's arches from her infant seat. P26
People in the public eye can also become icons for their brand. Richard Branson has become synonymous with everything Virgin. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are icons for the Rolling Stones. Michael Eisner, Jack Welch, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and others have also become icons for the brands they for. P26
There's packaging on people, too. Wigs as seen on British lords are icons of Georgian England (and British courts). Neck collars as seen in portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh are icons of another era. More recently, the Armani suit is iconic of a certain lifestyle, as are mod, goth, surfer, and skater clothing styles. Tattoos are the icons of a racy subculture. Cowboy hats are icons of the American West and country western music. Lederhosen is an icon of the European Alps (and slapstick humor). And the wedding dress is an icon of the marriage ceremony. P32/33
"The human brain has evolved to look for meaning in a sequence of events; that's what meaning is," reveals Althsul. "Our minds have evolved to understand complex events.
The search for meaning is a more powerful one than product attributes can display. What people are asking when they ask the brand question is, Who cares? Why does it have meaning in my life? How does it connect with how I see myself in my world? It may be an empty promise, but it's the juice." P48
In order to create something that people believe in and want to belong to, all elements of the primal code must be active.
It is not enough to create a flag. You must have a nation willing to follow it. P52
> Rituals are the meaningful repeated points of contact between you and your guest, customer, client, or target mar-ket. The weekly trip to the grocery store. Back-to-school shopping. Christmas shopping. Shopping for Valentine's Day or buying groceries for the Thanksgiving feast are rituals in themselves. These interactions with the customer can be flat experiences, or they can serve as enriching touch points that excite consumers and intensify the brand experience. P68

order to have the yin of believers you must also have the yang of nonbelievers. The pagans. The heathens and idolaters. Part of saying who you are and what you stand for is also declaring who you are not and what you don't stand for. The contrasting counterparts of Democrats are Republicans. There are hawks and doves. Pro-life and pro-choice. DOS/Java. National Rifle Association/the Brady Campaign. Internet/bricks and mortar. Cola/un-cola. Organic/processed Gas guzzlers/tree huggers. New York/L.A. The sacred and the profane. P70
All belief systems come with a set of specialized words that must be learned before people can belong. If you're a marathon runner you understand what it means to "hit the wall." If you are a computer user you understand what it means to "log on," what a "virus" is, and what it means to "crash." If you go to Starbucks you understand the difference between a "tall" and a "grande." To follow the world of Walt Disney you learned the songs and memorized names like Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Pluto, and Donald Duck. Perhaps you even taught yourself to speak like Donald. P72
"The thing about language," says Abley, "is that there's always going to be a need for groups to identify themselves and set themselves apart somehow. We live in a society which is incredibly complex and the only way to deal with that is to feel a part of a subgroup or to make ourselves an extended family generally, and so one of the really good ways to do that is to baffle outsiders.‚Äù P74/75
At the end of the day we all want to feel that we are a part of something larger than ourselves. As Sue Ellen Cooper, founder of the Red Hat Society, says, "It's much more fun to be part of something big." All belief systems have people who believe, advocates who feel that the brand offers a place where they can belong. That sense of belonging manifests itself in several ways. First, consumers invest themselves in your brand by purchasing products or services because they believe in them. Second, they are willing to help convince others to belong (as we know, this word of mouth is one of the oldest and best forms of advertising). Finally, advocates believe so strongly in the brand that they fiercely defend it against rivals. Try to tell a Mac user that they have to trade it for a PC. Tell a Ford truck owner that he has to drive a Chevy. And we all remember what happened when Coke tried to change their formula. P87
Coffee is highly ritualized to begin with, and at Starbucks the caffeinated ritual of affordable luxury is intensified: We stand in line to order our coffee, we stand in another line to get our latte, and then we stand again at the minibar to put in our Nutrasweet and grab a napkin.
Pagans? Instant Maxwell House and people who drink Coke for breakfast (or, if you're under thirty, Mountain Dew). Anyone who wants to order at Starbucks first had to learn the sacred words. Whether you're ordering a "venti" coffee, or an "iced grande decaf nonfat latte" you know that it only seems that you're paying by the syllable. P99/100

Primal branding is a simple way to decode the intangible power behind brands. In workshops called Primal Digs, we work together with companies to help them engineer and reverse engineer their brands and their company culture.
The primal code is a language, like genetic code or computer code. We help companies learn the vernacular of primal branding, by first explaining the seven pieces of code. Then they explore which pieces already exist in their company and brand(s), and which pieces are absent or have grown stale and tired. Too often, pieces of code are missing. People have forgotten or discarded their creation story (for example, when Smirnoff recently went back and discovered their ori-gins, it gave them incentive to go on to become the world's best-selling vodka). Some business people have not identified or do not understand the significance of their rituals. Even consumer electronics companies like Samsung and Best Buy, for example, understand today that how people relate to their products during the shopping rite is not just a feature-driven experience. P210
Sometimes when I explain primal branding, executives nod their heads and say, "Oh sure, we have every one of those things." Yet if you asked the ordinary consumer, they would reply they don't feel any vibrancy or connection to that brand. Why? The usual reason is that they really don't have all of the pieces of code. Or managers haven't communicated the pieces of code to the public as well as they think. This is typical brand boosterism, when brand leaders think consumers care as much about their brands as they do. The first step in primal branding is to determine where your brand exists in the minds of customers. Many companies already have customer information they can sort to determine how their brand aligns with the primal code and consumers. A brand audit can help you define which pieces of code you need to develop or focus on. You can do this by looking at each piece of code to see how it relates to your company, personality, product, or industry. P214/215
How did your company or idea start? Who started it?
Did it start because someone was frustrated, because the marketplace was changing, because someone had a dream?
Where did it start‚Äîwas it an idea two guys came up with on an airplane, did someone see a crack in the marketplace, did someone have an insight while on vacation? These are actual examples of inspiration. Whether the idea started in a hotel room, a garage, or borrowed space, it is important back story.
Often, the story of how the company started is so well known to old hands at the company that they assume everyone is aware of it and they neglect to inform new employees, new managers, new hires of every stripe. P216
The creed is the second piece of code. Many companies have invested hundreds of man and woman hours unraveling the company mission and distilling their products and services, hopes and dreams into a succinct statement. Sometimes that statement can become the creed. Often, however, the mission statement satisfies other internal objectives. The creed should answer the question, Why do we belong in people's lives? Why do we come to work in the morning? Why should people care? The answer might be, To invent. To dis-cover. To teach. To save. To discuss. To enlighten. What does your company celebrate? Is it precision quality? Breakthrough innovation? Best-of-class customer service? Incredible performance? Economics? P218
The expression of what your product or service is about becomes concentrated and instantly communicated in your icons. The question people often have is, How can I tell what my icons are? As discussed elsewhere in this book, icons can be as simple as your company logo or as discreet as senses like taste or smell. Icons can be the product itself. Ask yourself, What are the Wham! moments when the senses are slammed by a concentration of meaning instantly identified with your brand? How does your brand make an impression? Is it the product? The experience? A look? A taste? A smell? What is the first impression? What is the last impression? Vibrant brands have many icons that propel the brand. Starbucks, for example, has their iconic mermaid logo. But they also have that white cup that can be spotted from across the street, the corrugated paper comfort ring, the green aprons, barrista counter, and wood and hued environments, all icons of the Starbucks experience. P220/221
The longer a brand has been in existence, the more layered the icons become. For example, there is not just one icon for democracy United States-style. The icons run deep: the Stars and Stripes, Mount Rushmore, the Washington Monu-ment, the voting booth, the Lincoln Memorial, the United States Capitol building, the Statue of Liberty, and more. For over two hundred years the same accumulation has occurred for the rituals, sacred words, leaders, and other pieces of code that create the brand called "U.S.A.‚Äù P222
People are often as confused about what constitutes a ritual as they are about icons. I have outlined many examples of rituals throughout this book. As a general guide, rituals are actions that involve how the product is used, how the service is engaged, where and how the consumer goes to shop, and how the product is maintained, returned, renewed, down-loaded, or updated. One way of discerning the rituals involved with your product, service, person, or civic community is to think through how people become involved with your brand. Draw a timeline and write down the moment when people are first introduced to your brand (whether through word of mouth, a salesperson, or advertising), then the string of ritual events that follow: pulling into the store's parking lot, entering the store threshold, encountering the greeter, the ritual of walking through the aisles, what happens at checkout, then getting back in the car again. P223
As mentioned elsewhere, sales calls and telephone calls are also a ritual. If you want to hear a terrific phone experi-ence, call Nike headquarters. If you want a poor experience, call your phone company or your bank. As an exercise, describe how you would make those rituals easier, more per-sonal, and more rewarding. For example, do we really need to push our way through five layers of buttons only to have to repeat all of that same information again when we finally reach a human being?
Rituals can be positive or negative reinforcements of the brand. It's your job to determine which. P224/225
The pagans, or nonbelievers, are usually the easiest to iden-tify. They are most often your competition, another way of working (think Mac versus PC), other ways of thinking ("supply and demand" versus "on-demand"). Who are you not? What are you trying to avoid? Who are you up against?
While it is easy to set yourself up against the competitors that help differentiate you outside the company, it is more diffi-cult-and painful‚Äîto identify the pagans within your orga-nization. One software company was faced with people who couldn't attend to clients' software questions in a timely manner, resulting in lots of frustrated customers. In a primal session one of the people responsible for the slow service suddenly blurted out, "We're our own pagans." P225
It seems a function of human nature to create special words around the things we value. Whether those things are career, family, or products and services, they resonate more vibrantly when given their own vocabulary. What are the words that define your company or yourself? What words resonate internally or with consumers? What words help define who you are or what you want to become? For fifty years a mantra originally written for Cadillac in the 1930s-
"On Excellence" ‚Äîhas been passed on to hundreds of compa-nies. Occupations have their own terms of art. Lovers, families, and friends have their own special words, phrases, jokes that help to bind them together. Sacred words can also originate from a visionary leader.
Sometimes sacred words just happen. No one could have predicted the success of Verizon's "Can you hear me now?" query. Or Budweiser's old "Wassup?" campaign. The success of both were functions of execution, performance, and excellent luck. P226
Brands are ideologies with their own universe of truths, iconography, history, heroes, and demons. The power of a belief system is that it inherently contains relevance, vision, trust, empathy, leadership, vibrancy, resonance, and commitment, the very attributes companies spend millions of dollars each year trying to obtain.
Between exemplary examples like Nike and also-ran products like Lestoil lay thousands of companies in between.
These are brands that have recognizable icons, fulfilling rituals, and enriched creation stories, but that lack other parts of the primal construct and are vulnerable to attack from more compelling brands. P233
succinctly evidenced by their well-orchestrated experience.)
Creating a world of believers means creating a group of people who feel they belong to your ideals and want to convince others of your cause. People who wear Nikes instead of Adidas, drink Starbucks rather than Maxwell House, prefer Disney World over Universal and California wine over French will advocate their causes without blinking. Recall your first trip to Starbucks, your first trip to the grocery store or school in a new area where you relocated. Odds are, it was recommended to you by someone else. Advocates will tell you the why, what, who, and where without even being asked. This is what is commonly known as "word of mouth," the most potent and sought after form of delivering a brand message. The third-party endorsement of people who already belong to your brand, your belief, your cause is the strongest argument for persuading others. Their anecdotal personal histories persuade better than the millions of dollars funnelled into promotional partnerships, Web sites, magazine campaigns, out-of-home, radio advertising, stunts, and other devices designed to stun, divert, bushwhack, and beguile us on the sponsor's behalf. P236
You don't ride a bike forty miles an hour down a steep dirt road because you got that bike for fifty dollars less than the guy riding behind you. You ride that bike for self-fulfillment, for the adrenalin rush, because the fat guy living next door to you can't or won't or is afraid to; you ride for affirmation, to defy death; you ride to scare your mother; you ride for a sense of love or abandonment or companionship; you ride because you need the endorphins; you ride because you are a screaming kamikaze who needs to feel the rattle of the road in your bones in order to feel like your life has meaning and substance and emotions that can't be expressed sitting behind a desk or basking in the communal fire of prime-time television. And sometimes you just ride the bike to get exercise. P236
Think of things that mean something to you. They all come from someplace ("creation story"). They stand for something ("creed"). They are symbolized by a sign, a sound, a smell ("icon"). You do certain specified things regarding them ("rituals"). Certain words evoke that experience ("sacred words"). You contrast that experience against other experiences ("pagans"). They have an individual, whether real or fictional, who is behind the whole thing ("leader"). It's all about creating a sense of meaning. The resonance inherent in a brand subsumes the competition. When people believe in and belong to a brand experience it's no longer about the task, it's about the experience. P236/237
when people believe in something, they seek out others who believe in the same thing. These people can belong to a group of people who buy the same brand of coffee each morning or put on the same kind of shoes. They can be people who drive the same kind of car to work in the morn-ing, or work in the same company, or live in the same city.
They can be people who vote for the same political party, or who attend the same after-hours bullshit session, or watch the same sports events, or like the same music group, or play the same action game on the Internet. They call themselves enthusiasts, derived from the Greek word enthusiasmos, a state likened to being "filled with the gods." They call themselves fans, the short form for fanatics. They can be baseball nuts or skateboard freaks. Their most curious aspect is their extremism, their zeal. And it doesn't much matter if they are crazy about the coffee they drink or wild about their favorite car or human rights or saving the world. These people are committed. P240

### This Is Strategy
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2024
- **Author**: Seth Godin

To find a better strategy, we need to be prepared to walk away from the one we've defaulted into.
A strategy isn‚Äôt a map ‚Äì it‚Äôs a compass. Strategy is a better plan. 
WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT?
Once our basic needs for food, shelter and health are met, most people dance with three conflicting desires:
- Affiliation
- Status
- Freedom from fear
(We can probably add joy, wonder, thrills, satisfaction and other in-
ternal narratives, but for now let's focus on these three.)
Affiliation is community. Fitting in. Being liked. Affiliation is wearing the right fashion, using the correct salad fork and knowing the words to the song around the campfire.
Status is always relative. Who eats lunch first? Who's up and who's
down?
And freedom from fear is an internal construct. Fear can be used as
fuel, but it's more likely to be avoided.
Marketing works on these three principles. And systems all use them
to maintain their structure.
If you want to understand why someone makes a choice, look for what people actually want, not only the proxies and substitutes they say they want.
Elegance is simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
culture is the driver of most systems, and culture is the result of the interactions between and among people. Strategies stumble when they depend on someone with power dictating how things will occur.
If you want to grow a garden, you'll need to plant seeds, but it's the ecosystem and the climate that will determine what happens after that.
Strategy is the hard work of choosing what to do today to improve our tomorrow. 
A series of 17 questions shines a light on the work to be done. It brings tomorrow forward to today, right here and right now, allowing us to articulate a strategy.
- Who are we here to serve?
- What is the change we seek to make?
- What are our resources?
- What is the genre we're working in?
- Who has done something like this before me?
- What systems are in play?
- Am I changing someone's status?
- Why would anyone voluntarily choose to be part of this work?
- What will they tell their colleagues?
- Who gains in status, affiliation and power by supporting this work?
- Will early support translate into more support later?
- Where is the network effect?
- What do I need to learn to make this work?
- Who do I need to work with?
- Where is the dip and when should I quit?
- What will I do if it doesn't work out?
- How much is enough?
If you listen to the original recordings of rock stars like Sly Stone, Janis Joplin and Lou Reed, you'll hear that they started out doing their best to sound exactly like everyone else.
That's what the system seems to reward. That's what gets you a producer and a demo and apparently, a shot at stardom. Except it almost never works. The big step between musician and rock star is the decision to sound like yourself instead of seeking to sound like everyone else.
AVOIDING HINDSIGHT BIAS
Most business theories fall into an easy trap: They find a few successful examples and then explain how their theory explains their success.
Of course, they aren't clear how their theory doesn't apply to all the
similar businesses that failed.
The reliance on hindsight bias often leads individuals to mistakenly believe they possessed advance knowledge of an event's outcome, falsely convincing themselves that they could predict the event without empirical evidence, merely through logical deduction.
In truth we still don't know. We don't know why Facebook succeeded and Friendster failed. Why General Magic struggled but Airbb made it to the other side.
Anyone who promises a detailed road map is unaware of how com-
plex creating the future is.
All we can do is look for the right conditions, not expect a guarantee.
The first group are early adopters, not adapters. They're eager. They're looking for something new. Their role in the system is to bring inno-vation, and they gain status and satisfaction by looking for something better.
This is less than 3% of the population. That means that when you bring something new to the world, 97% of the folks you interact with will not embrace it.
The folks at the far end of the curve are adapters. They fight change.
It's a threat to them. Adapters have plenty of objections, but what they're really saying is, "I'm afraid."
Anthony lannarino teaches that that the job of a sales team isn't to persuade people to buy from us. It's to find the people who WANT to try 
something new, and to politely and eagerly send everyone else on their way.
The job of the marketer is to make something so remarkable that this tiny group of adopters can't stop telling their peers. They're the ones that get the word out, not you. This phenomenon has been clear for decades, and yet people keep looking for a shortcut.
A shortcut to change the entire system.
A shortcut to promote an idea to every human and explain why the
new way is better.
A shortcut to get picked.
Your idea might be rejected because it's not better. But it's probably going
to be rejected because it's new.
Author adrienne maree brown encourages us to move at the speed of trust. Critical connections are more important than critical mass. The next step isn't to host a huge rally. It's to create the conditions for just enough people to come back again and again and again, forming the nucleus for real change.
Paying it back is trading favors. Reciprocity is a natural human instinct, amplified by culture. If someone does a nice thing for you, you are inclined to do a nice thing in return.
Paying it forward means offering something to someone who can do nothing in return for you.
SCALE AND MAGIC
The smallest organizations have an advantage when they create projects.
With nothing to lose and few people to please, it's possible to create moments of magic. Small projects from small teams can leap forward with the confidence of knowing that they don't have far to fall.
When a project works, it's tempting and generous to scale it. Offer it to more people. Turn one successful restaurant into a chain, or a small medical practice into a much larger one.
And almost inevitably, it falters.
The only way to effectively scale magic is to create a strategy where
the scale is the magic.
Heinz ketchup is better because it's the regular kind, the safe kind, the normal kind. That's the magic they offer. Disney is magic because it offers predictable, industrialized, mass fun. They turned that from an oxymoron to a motto. It's the place to go if you want to go to where everyone else is going.
Projects where the scale is the magic have a network effect. The more
people who use them, the better they get.
BRINGING STRATEGY TO MARKETING
There are three steps:
- Tell a story, a true story, one that holds up. And tell it only to your smallest viable audience, the tiny group that is actually listening to you, that cares and that is among the early adopters. Create tension and urgency.
- Give this group a reason to share the story with others. Something that will increase their status, their affiliation with others, or increase the utility of supporting your product, service or cause.
Give them the scaffolding to do this.
- Help them, through use or narrative, alter the story to make it theirs.
This means that strategic marketing begins by seeing the path, the way the idea spreads over time and through the community.
It requires a specific story, not simply, "You can pick anyone and we're anyone." Instead, we seek to be of service to a small group, people who would miss us if we didn't exist.
Once this group finds affiliation and status from engaging with our work, we create the conditions for them to share the story with others‚Äî but they won't tell the story that attracted them in the first place. They'l tell a different story, also true, and one that will attract their friends.
Luxury isn't more utility‚Äîit's intentional waste: Luxury goods are items that are worth more (to some) because they cost more.
The cost itself is the benefit that is being sold.
There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, a Herm√®s saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put to.
Today, though, a more expensive resort, bottle of wine, or article of clothing is likely not the item of highest performance. It is simply a symbol that the purchaser is happy to understand and perhaps show off. Poor performance might even be part of the value proposition. Not only can you afford to pay extra, but you can afford to pay extra and have your feet hurt as well.
Money is a story, and price is a way of telling that story.
> How did Dorothy persuade the Lion, Tin Man, and Scarecrow to join her on the trip to see the Wizard? Did she make a case about how much she missed home? The lesson here is worth remembering. She created the conditions so that the others would get what they wanted by joining her. They got to move closer to their stated goals of courage, compassion, and smarts. But more than that, she offered them status and affiliation. The Wizard was simply a stepping-stone on the way to where they were hoping to go. 

Require effort and expense from the early adopters: When working with the pioneers, require effort and offer status. It's not convenient, easy, or free to go first-there's no tension in that.
Embrace the effort. The appearance of risk is actually a benefit for this cohort.
The fear of missing the new thing: Early adopters seek novelty. If you create an innovation, you've built an attractor for people who seek inno-vation.

The fear of being left behind: When a system begins to adopt a new idea, particularly one that amplifies a head start, others will follow because they can feel the tension that comes with waiting.

The fear of being left out: This isn't quite the same as being left behind.
This is the "everyone else is already doing this" tension of group dynamics.

The generosity of the network effect: When a colleague or friend asks you to join as a favor to them, there's tension about not granting this request.
The fear of being seen as a fraud: Surprisingly common, rarely talked about, it usually helps us avoid shortcuts and hustles, but it also holds us back from embracing bravery.

What will I tell my boss? Even nodes that aren't eager to explore new frontiers are aware that their organization might want them to do so.

And there are more:
The fear of failing, and its surprising cousin, the fear of succeeding.
The fear of responsibility.
The fear of speaking out or speaking up.
The fear of being judged.
The fear of being out of sync.
The fear of the new or the unfamiliar.
The fear of strangers.
The fear of insufficiency.
The fear of the end.
And the reason it's so difficult to talk about this: the fear of fear.
It became the bestselling luxury car in California for this reason. The early adopters adopted, and then plenty of luxury car buyers followed, because they didn't want to fall behind or look like technophobes.
It's worth noting that the number one thing that prompted conversations in parking lots (according to a Tesla insider) was the retracting door handles. People would walk over to a new Tesla and ask-not about the value of electric cars, or the shift they represented‚Äîabout the cool door handles.
> Trust leads to trust. Influence creates influence. The network effect is the dynamic of our time, and most of us don't even notice it. The value of a network goes up exponentially as more people engage
with it. People don't engage with your network because it's good for you.
They do it because it's good for them. The network effect challenges system architects to create assets that provide value for users that increase when they invite their colleagues to join in.

Or consider Prada's baseball cap, a $650 hat that offers no functional advantages over a $4 alternative except that the social benefits of wearing one in some communities are large enough that for those purchasers, it's a bargain. There are countless substitutes, but none of them can offer precisely the same combination of status, affiliation, and belonging that this ridiculous item can offer to the right person.
THRASHING AT THE START
Steve McConnell shares the most important lesson about project man-agement: Changing course and exploring your options are far cheaper at the start than they are at the end.
While this is obvious, we almost always do it backward.
It's only toward the end that the boss takes a look, that the community review board gets involved, that we share our idea with the salesforce because it's at the end that things begin to feel real and imminent, and busy and important and distracted people have trouble paying attention when they have competing emergencies.
The discipline of project management is to insist, "We're not going to write a line of code until you sign off on the storyboards" or "We're not going to lay a brick until the plans are approved." Once your project launches, it quickly evolves as a result of interactions with the community, the shifts in your insights, and the surprising way time unfolds.
And so a new project begins. Thrash again. At the beginning. Repeat.
COMMUNICATION WITH INTENT
The larger the team, the more we need to lean into the process of communication. It begins by being clear about our roles, our purpose, the change we seek to make, and the people we're seeking to serve. More than that, we need to create the conditions for this honest project-focused communication to continually occur without heroic effort. This is how buildings get built and movies get made-when our project culture is obvious and the proxies for progress and quality are clear, the work gets done. Consider this for a moment: Professional projects have project man-agers. If it's important, we don't wing it, or hope for the best. Instead, we're thoughtful and intentional about how we talk with each other.
This isn't completed in one meeting. This is the ongoing commitment to creating and maintaining a flow of information over time. The world changes. We‚Äôre changing it. Without a resilient communications system, the project stalls. Projects require strategy, but our strategy is directly related to our
ability to ship the work.
PROBLEMS ARE OPPORTUNITIES
When a decision is called for, there must be a problem to solve. If there are no problems, there's no need for projects and no room for growth.
Russ Ackoff's writing about systems asserts that problems have five
components:
- A decision-maker
- Elements of the situation that are controllable by the decision-maker
- Elements which are out of the decision-makers control

Fannish devotion is a gregarious impulse. It is possible to be a solitary fan and to worship from afar, but at some point most of us want to vent our passions with others, to pay homage with fellow enthusiasts. 'If you love something that much, you want to share it, you want to reach out to other people and talk about it,' says Kathy Larsen, who studies fan cultures at George Washington University. P2
Fans of Billie Holiday in the 1940s were no less emotional and committed than fans of Billie Eilish are today. Even before the invention of the word
'fan', young city-dwellers in the US flocked to concert halls with a zeal that alarmed their elders. 'Fandom is often characterized in media studies as a product of mass consumer culture in the twentieth century,' notes the cultural historian Daniel Cavicchi, who spent several years studying the diaries, scrapbooks and letters of music-lovers of the nineteenth century. Yet the basic practices associated with fandom - idealized connection with a star, strong feelings of memory and nostalgia, use of collecting to develop a sense of self, for example - precede the development of electronic "mass communication" technologies." P6/7
researchers at Virginia Tech University found that sports fans and political supporters process new information about their team or party in much the same way, by filtering it through the lens of group affiliation. What matters to people is not the information itself so much as the way it reflects on their group. Fans have always shown a dogged and sometimes irrational allegiance to their tribe, a trait that has become endemic in party politics.' P7
One of the curious things about the Partygate scandal was that Boris Johnson managed to retain so much support even after he had lost the moral argument. So long as our guy is ahead, do we care what they actually do? P8
when you love something that other people love, many of the traditional social boundaries fall away. We join them not so much to be entertained as to experience a particular reality, to broaden our perspective, to connect with like-minded others or to find meaning in life. This is not so different to why people participate in a religion, sign up to a political party or even join the army. Fandoms have all the power and influence of those institutions, and they are driven by the same fundamental psycho-social forces. P10
The human brain is wired to reach out. While those groupish tendencies can bring much strife, they are also the source of some of our greatest satisfactions. Fandoms offer the pleasures of tribalism with less of the harm: a feeling of belonging and shared culture, a sense of significance and purpose, improved mental well-being, reassurance that your most outlandish convictions will be taken seriously and the freedom to emulate (and dress like) your heroes. P11
The minimal group experiments showed that people require little prompting to categorize themselves with others and to favour members of their own group over anyone else. Groupishness - the dance of 'us' and 'them' - is a certainty of social life. We categorize people all the time, on lines of race, gender, class, religion, nationality, profession and so on, to help us understand our social environment. This might be a reflection of our ancient past, when survival depended on cooperation and the ability to distinguish friend from foe. We evolved to live in groups, a reality that shapes almost everything we do. P15
group membership gives people a distinct identity - they called it a 'social identity' - and that this provides
'some kind of meaning to an otherwise empty situation'? A social identity gives us a sense of ourselves in relation to others: we are who we are because of what we share with our in-group and what we don't share with those outside it. Social identity is separate from personal identity, which reflects individual traits such as physical appearance and personality. During those moments when you feel an integral part of a group - watching a football match, for example, or attending a Star Trek convention - your social identity (We're Trekkies!') will be more prominent than your personal one. P16
The groups we belong to have a big influence on our behav-iour. We rapidly adopt their norms and needs, their ways of thinking and doing. They become a part of us just as we become a part of them. Group membership is transient: we can have many social identities, only one of which is likely to be active at any one time. If you work as a nurse, you may wear a uniform and fill your conversation with medical terminology while you're at the hospital, but you're unlikely to do that when you're with your college friends (unless they're also nurses). Most of us find slipping between our various social worlds as easy as putting on a new coat. Each world demands something different of us: a different identity, a different self. If you've ever made a friend in one environment (at work, say) and then observed them in another (with their family), you'll know how surprising and even disconcerting it can be to watch someone skip across their group boundaries. P16/17
 Brain imaging studies show that we generate more neural activity in the emotional centres of our brain when we interact with 'insiders' than when we interact with 'outsiders'," In-group favouritism appears to be our natural default. P17
When people form a group, two things happen. The first is that the group feels compelled to distinguish itself from others - to signal its uniqueness. Its members may do this by wearing idiosyncratic colours (in a sports team), adopting an arcane ritual (in a faith group) or advocating a particular worldview (in a political party). The second thing is the pursuit of status: everyone wants their group to be as successful or prestigious as possible and tries to make it so. P19
The most avid sports fans don't think of themselves as supporters of their team. They're greater than that: they are their team. In the language of Tajfel and Turner, their group identity overrides their personal one to the extent that they feel a part of it as much as any of the players. In Fever Pitch, Nick Hornby's memoir of life as a fan of Arsenal Football Club, he describes his obsession as an 'organic connection'. 'One thing I know for sure about being a fan is this,' he writes. 'It is not a vicarious pleasure, despite all appearances to the contrary, and those who say that they would rather do than watch are missing the point.
Football is a context where watching becomes doing." P23
You can tell fans who identify strongly with their team by the way they speak. They might say, 'We won' or 'We lost', never
'They won' or "They lost'. In social science, this use of the first person pronoun is known as the 'categorized we'. It allows the speaker to extend the boundaries of the self, to create a special category of inclusiveness. The only time the categorized we is heard outside of sports fandoms is when it is used to express national identity, as in 'We won the war' - which tells you a lot about a sports fan's level of engagement. P23
The quality of connection matters. For a group to have healing powers - to offer protection from stress, increase resilience, speed up recovery or meet certain psychological needs - it has to feel emotionally significant. Part of the reason for this is that people who regard each other as members of the same club - who share a social identity - are much more likely to help each other out.
But feeling that we belong bestows its own psychological gifts: companionship, increased self-esteem, a sense of purpose, a feeling of control, a moral compass. It allows us to extend our loci of concern beyond our own well-being, to reach for a grander narrative for our lives and to find something meaningful in the things we share with others. P30
Being a fan allows you to be radical in original ways.
Depeche Mode enjoyed a huge following in Eastern Europe during the Soviet era among people who wanted an alternative means to channel their frustration with the status quo. We are Depeche-ist, like Communist, or Fascist, declares one fan in The Posters Came from the Walls, a documentary about the band's global following." To this day, Russian fans celebrate 'Dave Day' on lead singer Dave Gahan's birthday, which also happens to be a national holiday, giving them a perfect excuse to parade their Depeche-ist sympathies. P32
The media studies scholar Henry Jenkins defined fandom as a vehicle for marginalised subcultural groups (women, the young, gays etc) to pry open space for their cultural concerns' 4 Groups like these can become powerful forces for social change. In 2015, Rainbow Direction, a collective of LGBTQ fans of the boy band One Direction who had come together to fight homophobic bullying, achieved maximum recognition when members of the band started wearing their rainbow bracelets on stage. Social interaction is the psychological fuel for this kind of activism. P32/33
building connections with others is an evolutionary imperative that drives much of our behaviour. Yet it can be hard to achieve: other people can be difficult, and relationships can make us vulnerable. It isn't very surprising that people sometimes prefer to invest their social energy in a fictional character and settle for a relationship over which they have greater control. Think of the advantages.
Fictional characters are always available. They'll never ghost you.
They have dependable personalities: you know what you're in for. And since a lot of other people are bound to like them too, they can bring a ready-made circle of human friends - like Priyanka Bose's Miraculous group, or the many friendships that have grown out of a mutual love for Harry Potter. P37
Henry Jenkins, the media studies scholar, describes Comic-Con as 'a field of dreams' and cosplay as a way of making those dreams public." But the dreams are aspirational as well as fantas-tical. Cosplay allows fans to push the limits of what they can be and to experiment with their identities in playful ways. Cosplayers often deliberately pick characters that are very different from themselves, or characters of a different gender (known as crossplay), or even of a different age, just to see what it feels like.
Some choose characters with antisocial traits that they share but usually conceal - a chance to release their inner Darth Vader or Voldemort." Others embrace characters they would like to emulate, whose qualities or values they admire. In a study of 198 cosplayers recruited via social media, the psychologist Robin Rosenberg quotes a respondent who has wanted to cosplay as Wonder Woman for as long as she can remember: Wonder Woman was a beautiful princess, but strong and inde-pendent. She took care of herself and everyone she cared about, and didn't need a prince to rescue her. Those were important qualities to me growing up in an all-woman household... In Wonder Woman I saw the best qualities of my mother, and the type of woman I wanted my sister and I to become. I've always idolized her from childhood and wanted to be' her when I grew up." P43
in their fursona personalities, they scored significantly higher than in their everyday personalities on every trait, particularly extraversion. Changing their outer identity appeared to change their inner one. 'Fursonas tend to be bigger, larger-than-life versions of the self, says Plante. 'So, happier and funnier, more outgoing and confident. But also more serious, more studious, friendlier. It's an idealised version.
This principle applies to other fandoms too. When Reysen assessed the personalities of sports enthusiasts in both fan and non-fan mode, he found a similar pattern, though the direction and magnitude of the changes were different. In team mode, sports fans were more extraverted but less conscientious, less agreeable and less emotionally stable. That sounds about right: on the terraces at a football match or in the bleachers at a baseball game, irascibility and confrontation are the norm. Being a fan may be transformative, but each fandom transforms us in its own unique way. P47
In her presentation, Merrick talked about the friendships she has made as a member of fandoms and a writer of fan fiction, and how they have 'changed everything' for her. 'Fandoms give people power, she said. Later, I asked her what she meant. She explained that in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, it had become clear that society is often blind towards people who are different. 'Can you imagine being an asexual autistic dyslexic person? You're so specialized and so small that you're invisible. If the entire black community is invisible, what chance do you have of being seen? But then you write a story and somebody reads it, or you read a story and you recognize yourself in it. You see that you are valid. That's the power.‚Äô P55
The audience seemed caught between rapture and melancholy as if calling to mind a happy memory they didn't want to let ga. Outside, I asked a Glasegian couple, Billy and Sandra Madden, what the music meant to them.
They had grown up in the 196os, and the Beatles provided the soundtrack to their youth, they said. The songs acted as memory markers for the things that had happened to them and the people they had met. P72
In 2015, the men's magazine GQ described the audience at a One Direction concert as 'an ocean of 20,000 wide-open mouths, hundreds of pleading white eyes, 40,000 palms raised skywards, a dark-pink oil slick that howls and moans and undulates with every impish crotch-thrust from their idols' plinths' 2 The writer, a thirty-four-year-old man, admitted that he had left the gig early, complaining about what he called
'the shrill sonic boom of a whole generation of women coming of age. He had made a common ethnographic error in trying to judge the norms of an in-group by contemplating it from the outside. The first impulse of those who don't understand a culture has often been to rage against it. P75
While most celebrities are careful to protect themselves from the excesses of fandom, the demands of their most persistent fans can be hard to deal with. Recently, Nancy Baym, a communications scholar at Microsoft Research, interviewed dozens of well-known performers for a study on the interaction between musicians and their audiences." Nearly all her subjects, who included Billy Bragg, Lloyd Cole, Kristin Hersh from the rock band Throwing Muses and Roger O'Donnell, keyboard player in The Cure, told her that a small number of fans assume the relationship is mutual and mistake their adulation for friendship. This false intimacy can be unsettling; it is hard for performers to strike a balance. They can try to distance themselves from fans who communicate too much or with too much intensity, but they often rely on the familiarity of social media to keep their audiences close, resulting in mixed messages. Fans love being party to their idols' private lives. Those who follow Ariana Grande on Instagram will have seen her feeding pizza to her dog or model-ling a dress in her home. Katy Perry, who has a bigger audience on Twitter than any other woman, is well known for opening up to her followers in this way. On a typical occasion a while back, she tweeted twelve times over the course of a week, offering titbits of personal information such as her love of tacos, her delight at cherry trees coming into blossom and her support for a presidential candidate. Most fans revel in such intimacies; for a few, it can lead to a morbid fixation. P79
isolated. Fandoms are inherently social - often joyously so - which accounts for many of the psychological benefits they bring. One of the incentives for being part of a fandom is that you get to do things with others. You might go to the same gigs, or rave together on social media about an artist's new album. At the extreme end of the scale, the opposite is true. Pathological fans are inherently anti-social. They hunt alone, and their isolation fuels their dysfunctionality, since they have no one to temper their fantasies or the appropriateness of their emotions. P82
Today, as well as writing and producing music, Jones researches and lectures in social theory - including fan behaviour - at Bath Spa University, a role that has helped him reflect on his experience with Gay Dad and, more generally, the relationship between artists and their audiences. He says it is crucial for an artist to realize that they can never control their public persona, which is based not so much on who they are but on what their fans want from them. 'As a performer you have to accept that what other people think about you is as valid as what you think about your-self. You provide a social function: you become a cipher for a set of values or ideas that they may wish to share or embody as a group. What's damaging for artists is when they take that seriously and push back and say, no, I'm not like that. It's easier to give the fans some of what they need, because at some point you have to admit that you are complicit in it. I didn't really understand that until it was too late.‚Äô P84
The therian community defines itself as a fandom and shares many of the psychological characteristics of regular fandoms. Therians are on a quest for identity, meaning and a sense of belonging just like Janeites, Trekkies and Potterheads. More than any other fandom, they illustrate the protective effects of being part of a group: their life experience and their psychology are so different to most people's that they often feel profoundly isolated until they find each other. P118
Popular culture, rich in imagery and metaphor, is often where young people start their search for meaning. P124
I heard similar versions of this story over and over from different therians. Caesar the coyote told me that his introduction to the community was 'unquestionably one of the happiest moments of my life: finding out that you're not alone, that these feelings and experiences do have some validity beyond myself, that I'm not necessarily on a deserted island after all'. Blayz, who spent years trying to figure out his strange canine sensations, came close to dismissing them as 'the delusions of a madman, nothing more than a side-effect of mental illness'. When he discovered that he wasn't the only one who felt this way, it was like an enormous avalanche of "aha" moments all at once. P137
As with any social group, the therian community entertains plenty of drama; therians disagree with each other like anyone else. There are differences of opinion, for example, over the causes of therianthropy, the distinction between therians and otherkin, and whether it is appropriate to discuss the sexual feelings that some therians have towards animals." But the prevailing impression is that the community is a source of great strength, and that many therians would be lost without their therian family. In this way, it resembles other fandoms. Social psychologists have found that members of minority or disadvantaged groups who experience persistent prejudice or criticism respond by identifying more closely with their own group, offsetting any potential harm with the psychological advantages of belonging. It might sound paradoxical, but stigma can become a strength when shared with others. P138
The shadow of the negative stereotype does not fall on all fans equally. Sports fans are rarely shamed for being excessively zealous their commitment to the cause is expected, even applauded. P143
sports fans - and particularly male sports fans - continue to get a pass across the board? In an interview a few years ago, she explained:
The degree of ridicule that a male sports fan experiences - even if he paints himself half-green and half-white and goes to an Eagles game half-naked - is vastly different than the potential ridicule tossed at a male media fan who paints himself green and white and goes to Comic Con half-naked as an alien something-or-other.*
Sports is one of the few male-dominated fandoms, and it's possible that the shaming of pop culture fandoms, which tend to be female-dominated, is partly a response by some men to what they perceive to be inappropriate behaviour by women.
Fortunately, in recent years it has become easier for fans of all kinds to show their colours without being humiliated for it.
Zubernis suggests this is due to the proliferation of social media platforms such as Tumblr, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, each of which has its own norms and values that determine what is acceptable. 'The sheer heterogeneity has changed how fans relate to each other and to the broader culture,' she told me over email.¬Æ Fan communities have become part of the mainstream, making it easier than ever to participate in the conversation. This hasn't stopped fans disrespecting other fans, or being disrespected by non-fans. Social media can be vile. P144
Stever had conducted a study of Jackson fans seventeen years earlier, and after he died some of them reconnected with her on Facebook. They were basically looking for people to grieve with;' she says. "They said, "We knew you'd understand." Psychologists have found that social media plays an important role in helping fans cope with the death of a favourite celebrity? By turning private grief into a public ritual, it allows them to connect with other people who 'get it', and to share their pain." (Studies have shown that at times of tragedy, having other people around to supervise your sadness generally leads to a healthier outcome.) On 1o January 2016, the day Bowie lost his fight against cancer, fans paid their respects by sending more than 2.3 million tweets with the hashtag #RIPDavidBowie (at its peak, this reached 20,000 every minute).!8 This is the modern way, but it is not the only way. That same night, thousands of people gathered on the streets of Brixton in South London, where Bowie grew up, to sing his songs, leave flowers and write epitaphs on the wall opposite the Tube station. Unlike the tweet cascade, this impromptu wake had a lasting impact, turning the neighbourhood into a permanent memorial and a pilgrimage destination for Bowie's fans. P149
How do characters who have never lived become so real? Why do they matter to us so much? In 2019, researchers at Erasmus University in Rotterdam asked fifteen fans of 'deceased' fictional characters how they had processed their grief and whether they took anything meaningful from their deaths. One of them, a young woman who had been particularly affected by the loss of Sirius Black in Harry Potter, had this to say:
You see how someone develops. When you get to know someone's layers, in different situations, you get attached to these people.
You form a connection, you know? The longer you follow someone, know someone ... It just becomes real." P151
If you are a fan of anything - a fictional character, a celebrity, a sports team - what happens to them to some extent happens to you too. Your self-esteem and sense of identity are tied to their success; you are vulnerable to their misfortunes. This is why some sports fans have a second team that they can turn to if their main one fails, and why some even bet against their team to off-set the potential emotional hit of losing It is why all fans suffer some cognitive dissonance when their heroes transgress or behave in a way that conflicts with their own core values. It can be disorientating when someone you love or identify with lets you down. Since J. K.
Rowling started sharing her controversial views about trans women - she believes that trans activism is eroding the rights and threatening the safety of cis-gender women - some of the Harry Potter fans who disagree with her have vowed never again to read her books or watch the films. They have become reluctant anti-fans, and not without considerable sorrow at the loss of a world that meant so much to them. P152
Psychological studies have shown that people who identify strongly with celebrities find it easier to excuse them when they offend: they manage to 'decouple' their wrongdoings from their achievements. This may be why so many of Tiger Woods' admirers stuck with him after he admitted in 2009 to having had multiple extramarital affairs, and why the jersey of basketball star Kobe Bryant remained a top seller after he was charged with sexual assault in 2003.* One explanation is that impassioned fans have invested too much in the relationship to contemplate their idol's fall from grace: if 1 acknowledge that my role model is a sinner, where does that leave me? In the case of Michael Jackson, this seems too simplistic an analysis. Those fans who rallied against the media in the wake of Leaving Neverland were not seeking to excuse him - they simply didn't believe that the allegations against him were credible. 'His fans would be more willing to give him the benefit of the doubt than other people, for sure,' says Mark Duffett, who studies popular music fandoms at the University of Chester. 'But if there was cast-iron proof [that the allegations were true], I think you would find a mass defection from the fandom very quickly. Those people who are heavily invested in him would go through some kind of grieving process.‚Äô P154/155
As hard as we might try, it can be difficult to ignore what other people think of us and the things we cherish. After all, reputations count. Loyal fans often pretend to be impervious to criticism, but when public opinion turns against their idol - as it did with Michael Jackson - they are usually quick to defend them. P157


### The Culture Code

  The first;
  The most powerful;
  The most recent memory 
When I put groups of consumers together, I asked them different questions. 
> I didn't ask them what they wanted in a Jeep; l asked them to tell me about their earliest memories of Jeeps. Respondents told me hundreds of stories, and the stories had a strong recurring image-of being out on the open land, of going where no ordinary car could go, of riding free of the restraints of the road. Many people spoke of the American West or the open plains. I retuned to those wary Chrysler executives and told them that the Code for Jeep in America is HORSE. 

Their notion of turning the Wrangler into just another SUV was ill advised. SUVs are not horses.
Horses don't have luxury appointments. Horses don't have butter-soft leather, but rather the tough leather of a saddle. The Wrangler needed to have removable doors and an open top because drivers wanted to feel the wind around them, as though they were riding on a horse.
The executives weren't particularly moved. After all, they had vast research that told them consumers said they wanted something else.
Maybe people once thought of Jeeps as horses, but they didn't want to think of them that way any longer. I asked them to test my theory by making a relatively minor adjustment to the car's design: replacing the square headlights with round ones. Why? Because horses have round eyes, not square ones.
When it turned out that it was cheaper to build the car with round headlights, the decision became easier for them to make. They tested the new design and the response was instantly positive. Wrangler sales rose and the new "face" of the Wrangler became its most prominent and marketable feature. In fact, the car's logo has incorporated its grille and round headlights ever since. P2
The Culture Code is the unconscious meaning we apply to any given thing‚Äîa car, a type of food, a relationship, even a country-via the culture in which we are raised. The American experience with Jeeps is very different from the French and German experience because our cultures evolved differently (we have strong cultural memories of the open frontier; the French and Germans have strong cultural memories of occupation and wat). Therefore, the Codes-the meanings we give to the Jeep at an unconscious level-are different as well.
The reasons for this are numerous (and I will describe them in the next chapter), but it all comes down to the worlds in which we grew up. It is obvious to everyone that cultures are different from one an-other. What most people don't realize, however, is that these differences actually lead to our processing the same information in different ways. P5/6
My journey toward the discovery of cultural codes began in the early 1970s. I was a psychoanalyst in Paris at the time, and my clinical work brought me to the research of the great scientist Henri Laborit, who drew a clear connection between learning and emotion, showing that without the latter the former was impossible. The stronger the emotion, the more clearly an experience is learned.
Think of a child told by his parents to avoid a hot pan on a stove. This concept is abstract to the child until he reaches out, touches the pan, and it burns him. In this intensely emotional moment of pain, the child learns what "hot" and "burn" mean and is very unlikely ever to forget it.
The combination of the experience and its accompanying emotion creates something known widely as an imprint, a term first applied by Konrad Lorenz. Once an imprint occurs, it strongly conditions our thought processes and shapes our future actions. Each imprint helps make us more of who we are. The combination of imprints defines us. P6
While the Japanese had an extremely strong emotional connection to tea (something I learned without asking in the first hour of the ses-sions), they had, at the most, a very superficial imprint of coffee.
Most, in fact, had no imprint of coffee at all.
Under these circumstances, Nestle's strategy of getting these consumers to switch from tea to coffee could only fail. Coffee could not compete with tea in the Japanese culture if it had such weak emotional resonance. Instead, if Nestl√© was going to have any success in this market at all, they needed to start at the beginning. They needed to give the product meaning in this culture. They needed to create an imprint for coffee for the Japanese.
Armed with this information, Nestl√© devised a new strategy. Rather than selling instant coffee to a country dedicated to tea, they created desserts for children infused with the flavor of coffee but without the caffeine. The younger generation embraced these desserts. Their first imprint of coffee was a very positive one, one they would carry throughout their lives. Through this, Nestl√© gained a meaningful foothold in the Japanese market. While no marketer will likely ever be able to convince the Japanese to abandon tea, coffee sales‚Äî-nearly nonexistent in 1970‚Äînow approach half a billion pounds per year in Japan. Understanding the process of imprinting-and how it related directly to Nestl√©'s marketing efforts-unlocked a door to the Japanese culture for them and turned around a floundering business venture. P9
An imprint and its Code are like a lock and its combination. If you have all of the right numbers in the right sequence, you can open the lock. Doing so over a vast array of imprints has profound implica-tions. It brings us to the answer to one of our most fundamental ques-tions: why do we act the way we do? Understanding the Culture Code provides us with a remarkable new tool‚Äîa new set of glasses, if you will, with which to view ourselves and our behaviors. It changes the way we see everything around us. What's more, it confirms what we have always suspected is true-that, despite our common humanity, people around the world really are different. The Culture Code offers a way to understand how. P11
The discovery sessions for cars brought up some very strong emo-tions. People came to me after the third hour to say that memories brought them to tears, filled them with joy, or even made them extremely uncomfortable. This is not unusual. In fact, some form of this happens at nearly every discovery session I do even the ones for office products and toilet paper.
Emotions are the keys to learning, the keys to imprinting. The stronger the emotion, the more clearly the experience is learned.
Think again of that child and the hot pan. Emotions create a series of mental connections (I call them mental highways) that are reinforced by repetition. These mental highways condition us to see the world in predictable ways. They are the path from our experience with the world (such as touching a hot pan) to a useful approach to the world (avoiding all hot things in the future).
We do the overwhelming majority of our learning when we are children. By the time we are seven, most of our mental highways have been constructed. But emotion continues to provide us with new imprints throughout our lives. Most Americans of the Boomer generation can remember where they were and what they were doing when they learned of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Most Americans alive today can vividly relive the experience of watching the World Trade Center towers fall. This is because these experiences are so emotionally powerful that they are effectively seared onto our brains.
We will never forget them, and the simple mention of the topic sends us back to that moment when we imprinted it. P17
One can tell the same story with either a sword or a tennis racket, which means that the content isn't essential to the meaning. You could say the same thing about West Side Story, whose "content" is different from Romeo and Juliet's but which tells the same tale. P20
When looking at why people act in certain ways or do certain things, we need to look past the content and into the structure. In any situation, there are three distinct structures in action. The first is the biological structure, the DNA. Monkeys, human beings, cows, and giraffes are made of the same content. However, each species is unique because the organization of its DNA-its structure--is unique. The next structure is the culture. All cultures have a language, an art, a habitat, a history, and so on; the way all these elements, this con-tent, is organized creates the unique identity of each culture.
The final structure is the individual. Within the DNA that makes us human there is an infinite variety. Further, each of us has a unique relationship with our parents, siblings, and family that shapes our individual mental scripts and creates our unique identity. Even identical twins end up with unique identities. One was born first, the other second. They are never going to be at exactly the same place at the same time, and, little by little, they will start developing different perspectives on the world. They begin with the same content but develop different structures. P20/21
Even our most arbitrary actions are the result of the trips we take down our mental highways. We take these trips hundreds of times a day, making decisions about what to wear, what to eat, where to go, what to say in conversation, and so on. What most people don't real-ize, however, is that there is a Code required to make these journeys.
Think of the Code as a combination that unlocks a door. In this case, we need nor only to punch in the numbers, but also to punch them in in a specific order, at a specific speed, with a specific rhythm, etc.
Every word, every action, and every symbol has a Code. Our brains supply these Codes subconsciously, but there is a way to discover them, to understand why we do the things we do. P24
These messages vary greatly from culture to culture, and, therefore, so do the Codes. For example, I conducted discovery sessions about cheese in France and in America. The Codes we uncovered could not have been more different. The French Code for cheese is ALIVE.
This makes perfect sense when one considers how the French choose and store cheese. They go to a cheese shop and poke and prod the cheeses, smelling them to learn their ages. When they choose one, they take it home and store it at room temperature in a cloche (a bell. shaped cover with little holes to allow air in and keep insects out).
The American Code for cheese, on the other hand, is DEAD. Again, this makes sense in context. Americans "kill" their cheese through pasteurization (unpasteurized cheeses are not allowed into this coun try, select bunks of cheese that have been prewrapped-mummified, i you will-in plastic (like body bags), and store it, still wrapped air-tight, in a morgue also known as a refrigerator. P25
We can return one more time to our example of the PT Cruiser to show how these different cultural Codes affect our responses to things. My review of hundreds of stories told by participants during the discovery sessions revealed that the American Code for cars is IDENTITY. Americans want cars that are distinctive, that will not be mistaken for any other kind of car on the road, and that trigger memories of Sunday drives, the freedom of getting behind the wheel for the first time, and the excitement of youthful passion. A car with a strong identity, such as the PT Cruiser or, as I illustrated earlier, the Jeep Wrangler, has a much better chance of breakout sales than a cookie-cutter sedan. P26
By avoiding the Code for seduction in their advertising, L'Or√©al created a winning strategy. They went "productively off Code." When an advertiser knows that associating a product with a certain Code will trigger negative feelings, it can choose to sidestep that Code com-pletely. Another approach, particularly useful when a negative association is unavoidable (as we will see later with the Code for alcohol), is to subtly acknowledge the Code in such a way as to lessen its impact. This latter strategy is useful to any individual attempting to be seductive. After all, there is no way to avoid engaging in seduction unless one is resigned to celibacy. A useful tool here is disarming hon-esty‚Äî-letting the object of one's affection know of one's interest directly to avoid any sense of trickery or manipulation. The negative Code is still there, but the honesty-‚Äîthe unstated acknowledgment of the Code-will blunt its force. P49
When I read what people write during discovery sessions, I look not at what they say (remember, you can't believe what people say), but at the common messages. I don't look at the context, but at the grammar. Not the content, but the structure. In doing this with the pieces people wrote about sex, I noticed something in the cadence of the writing; in the regular appearance of words like "scared," "scary," and "anxious" and of phrases like "I felt beaten up" or "I wondered how I would make it"; in the use of clipped sentences and a certain breathlessness in the tone. It brought to mind confrontation, but not the kind of confrontation that is resolved peacefully, with both sides coming away winners. Rather, it brought to mind the kind of confrontation that always has at least one loser and often two. A violent confrontation.
In fact, the American Culture Code for sex is VIOLENCE. P51
Life is tension. Everything we experience in life lies somewhere on an axis between two extremes. One cannot truly know pleasure without knowing pain. One cannot legitimately feel joy without having felt sorrow. The degree to which we feel an experience depends on where that experience lies on the axis (a little painful, overwhelmingly joyful, and so on). The same system that communicates pain to your brain also communicates pleasure, as every sadomasochist already knows.
Similar tensions define cultures. Every culture is composed of an endless number of archetypes and of the tensions between each archetype and an opposing one. For example, one of the primary tensions in the American culture is the one between freedom and prohibition. We consider freedom an inalienable right. We have fought numerous wars to protect it, and our citizens are willing to die to maintain it. At the same time, however, our culture is very strongly inclined toward prohibition. We believe we shouldn't drink too much, play too much, or exhibit too much wealth. While the axis itself never changes, where a culture stands on a particular axis varies from era to era. P55
One can trace the distinctive evolution of each culture on the planet to the survival needs of that culture.
Thus, we find the Codes for the elements of a culture when we understand how our reptilian brains address that element. This process is especially clear when we look at the Code most closely related to survival‚Äî-health‚Äîand the Code for youth. P74
every species is distinguished by the structure of its DNA. I call this the biological scheme. In addition, every culture has a cultural scheme that is an extension of the biological scheme. The biological scheme identifies a need, and the cultural scheme interprets it within the parameters of a particular culture. "Isomorphism," a term borrowed from biology, chemistry, and mathematics, is commonly applied to the continuum berween the biological scheme and the cultural scheme.
For example, our human biological scheme dictates that our physical comfort peaks within a certain air temperature range. If the air is too hot, we become lethargic. If it is too cold, we run the risk of illness and, in the extreme, death. To address the heat issue, we developed air conditioning. Each culture, however, regards the use of air conditioning differently, depending on its cultural scheme. Americans consider air conditioning a necessity (virtually every car in America comes equipped with an air-conditioning system), while Europeans consider it a luxury (in the UK, air conditioning is not standard equipment even on a Rolls-Royce). I recall visiting a four star hotel in Germany a few summers ago. My room was very hot; when I asked the concierge to address the problem, he told me that the hotel didn't have air conditioning because the weather only got this hot one month a year. This might have been sensible from their perspective, but as an American, I found it uncomfortable. It had an unpleasant impact on my stay and I kept thinking that even a room in an inexpensive motel in the United States would have had a temperature more to my liking. The German hotel's policy was appropriate for the human biological scheme, but not for my American cultural scheme.
On the other hand, I regularly hear Europeans complain that American stores are too cold in the summer. Again, the conflict lies in the cultural schemes. Americans like to be cool, even extremely cool.
Research bas shown that the coldest stores in America tend to be the most expensive. Since air conditioning is a necessity, we need extreme air conditioning to convey a sense of luxury. Biological schemes are specific to each species, and are not nego-riable. We breathe with our mouths, noses, and lungs rather than with gills. These biological schemes pre-organize the way a Culture Code is created and evolves. They establish the parameters within which & particular culture can survive. A culture that spends some of its tme underwater can work. One that spends all of its time underwater can-not. As long as a culture acknowledges the limits of biology, however. it is free to roam within the parameters. We all need to cat, but the American culture created fast food while the French created slow food. Every species needs to reproduce itself, but some culture's employ polygamy (one man with several women) while others prefer polyandry (one woman with several men), These are cultural answer to the same biological scheme. P93/94
As we've established, a culture is a survival kit we inherit at birth. Our culture is what it is (and it changes very, very slowly) because it is best suited to the conditions under
which its members live. Because of this, attempts to impose changes that are fundamentally opposed to the Code of a particular culture are destined to fail. P130
nothing that contradicts the Code of a culture succeeds for any length of time. P140
When one seeks to bring something new to a culture, one must adapt the idea to the culture. It doesn't work the other way. P140
Alibis make us feel better about what we do because they feel logical and socially acceptable. Whenever I present a client with a Code, I also present him with an alibi or two gleaned from the discovery ses-sions. These are important to the client, because an effective marketing campaign needs to consider the alibis while addressing the Code.
For instance, a food packager who focused only on the effectiveness of the fuel in its product without also suggesting that the product tasted good would leave an important selling point unstated, Alibis address the "conventional wisdom" about an archetype, the kind of thing you are likely to hear in a focus group. While you can't believe what people say, it would be a mistake not to listen to it and incorporate it into your message. At a personal level, an alibi often has credibility even if it is not the reason why a person does what he does. Your schedule really might make it difficult for you to eat as well as you should. It isn't the reason you're fat, but once you address why you are checking out, you still need to come up with an eating plan that accommodates your hours. Just as companies need to consider both the Code and the al-ibi, so do individuals. Any long-held excuse has at least a modicum of validity. P155/156
Alibis help us to make sense of the messages the Codes send us. Few of us are aware enough of our motivations to understand that our excitement over that pending shopping trip comes from the reconnection that trip will provide. What we tell ourselves instead is that we need things‚Äîshoes for an upcoming social event, clothes for the kids' new school year, a new range before the old one stops working, a new car because the other one is coming off lease. Similarly, few of us acknowledge that we're buying "stripes" when we buy our luxury items. Instead, the car is for entertaining clients; the built-in swimming pool is for the children and their friends. Alibis work because they seem legitimate. They give us good reason to do things we want to do anyway. We can reconnect with life. We can exhibit our stripes. And our cortexes won't give us the least bit of trouble. P169
However, commerce can. Understanding that brands stand a far greater chance of succeeding globally when they emphasize their unique heritage (consider Starbucks, Mercedes, Sony, or any number of others) illuminates a fundamental link between culture and viability on the world stage. When a brand identifies itself with its culture, it underscores that culture's contribution to the world. These contri-butions‚Äî and the unspoken invitation to all cultures to contribute what they do best‚Äîmake the concept of globalization not only palatable but also enviable.
A brand is more than a name or a product. A successful brand is an icon, a powerful expression of a cultural archetype. Therefore, brand managers are not just in charge of reinvesting in the emotional bank account of their brand, but are also in charge of a more important mission: to perpetuate the elements of character of a culture and therefore maintain cultural diversity in the world. In many ways, they are in charge of the Culture Code, in charge of communicating to the global community the power and fascination of culture. P205


### Tribes
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2008
- **Author**: Seth Godin

A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea. For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another. A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate. P1
Forty years ago, Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead made some decisions that changed the music industry forever. You might not be in the music business and you may never have been to a Dead concert, but the impact the Dead made affects almost every industry, including yours.
In addition to grossing more than $100 million during their career, the Dead helped us understand how tribes work.
They didn't succeed by selling records (they only had one Top 40 album). Instead, they succeeded by attracting and leading a tribe.
Human beings can't help it: we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanisms is to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of likeminded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging and the thrill of the new.
When one Deadhead says to another, "2-14-70," it's like a secret code. The smiles and the hugs and handshakes define who we are-being in a tribe is a big part of how we see ourselves. We want to belong not to just one tribe, it turns out, but to many. And if you give us tooks and make it easy, we'll keep joining.
Tribes make our lives better. And leading a tribe is the best life of all. P2/3
the Internet eliminates geography.
This means that existing tribes are bigger, but more im-portant, it means that there are now more tribes, smaller tribes, influential tribes, horizontal and vertical tribes, and tribes that could never have existed before. Tribes you work with, tribes you travel with, tribes you buy with. Tribes that vote, that discuss, that fight. Tribes where everyone knows your name. The professionals at the CIA are a tribe and so are the volunteers at the ACLU. P4
Marketing used to be about advertising, and advertising is expensive. Today, marketing is about engaging with the tribe and delivering products and services with stories that spread
Today, the market doesn't want the same thing it wanted yesterday. Marketing, a hundred years of incessant marketing, has drilled into us a thirst for what's new. And new isn't so stable, is it? P13/14
It's worth taking a second is think about what it really means to be a tribe.
In Permission Marketing, years ago, I wrote about how marketers must earn the right to deliver anticipated , personal, and relevant messages to people who want to get them. And that's still correct, as far as it goes.
But tribes go much further. That's because in addition to the messages that go from the marketer or the leader to the tribe, there are the messages that go sideways, from member to member, and back to the leader as well.
The Grateful Dead understood this. They created concerts to allow people not just to hear their music, but to hear it together. That's where the tribe part comes in. P18
Great leaders create movements by empowering the tribe to communicate. They establish the foundation for people to make connections, as opposed to commanding people to follow them.
This is how Skype spread around the world. Cofounder Niklas Zennstr√∂m understood that overthrowing the tyranny of the phone companies was too big a project for a small company. But if he could empower the tribe to do it them-selves, to connect to one another and to spread the word, he would be able to incite a movement.
Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it involved much the same dynamic. The collapse of East Germany wasn't the work of one hardworking activist. Instead, it was the gradual but inexorable growth of the tribe, a loosely coordinated movement of activists that gained in force until it couldn't be stopped.
One after another, intractable problems fall in the face of movements. P20
As we saw earlier, it takes only two things to turn a group of people into a tribe:
- A shared interest
- A way to communicate
The communication can be one of four kinds:
- Leader to tribe
- Tribe to leader
- Tribe member to tribe member
- Tribe member to outsider
So a leader can help increase the effectiveness of the tribe and its members by
- transforming the shared interest into a passionate goal and desire for change;
- providing tools to allow members to tighten their com-munications; and
- leveraging the tribe to allow it to grow and gain new members.
Most leaders focus only on the third tactic. A bigger tribe somehow equals a better tribe. In fact, the first two tactics almost always lead to more impact. Every action you take as a leader can affect these three elements, and the challenge is to figure out which one to maximize. P21
Anatomy of a Movement
Senator Bill Bradley defines a movement as having three el-
ements:
1. A narrative that tells a story about who we are and the future we're trying to build
1. A connection between and among the leader and the tribe
1. Something to do the fewer limits, the better
Too often organizations fail to do anything but the third. P23
In an article posted on his Technium Web site, Kevin Kelly brilliantly described the world of "1,000 True Fans." A true fan, he argues, is a member of the tribe who cares deeply about you and your work. That person will cross the street to buy from you or bring a friend to hear you or invest a little extra to support you.
An individual artist needs only a thousand true fans in her tribe. It's enough.
It's enough because a thousand fans will bring you enough attention and support to make a great living, to reach more people, to do great work. It's enough because a thousand fans, true fans, form a tribe.
A true fan brings three friends with him to a John Mayer concert or to the opening of a Chuck Close exhibit. A true fan pays extra to own the first edition, or buys the hardcover, instead of just browsing around on the Web site. Most important, a true fan connects with other true fans and amplifies the noise the artist makes.
A corporation or a nonprofit or a church may need more than that- perhaps a million fans if you're Starbucks, or fifteen million if you're running for president. But it's beyond doubt that there's a number‚Äî you can figure out what it is-and it's probably fewer people than you imagine.
Too many organizations care about numbers, not fans.
They care about hits or turnstile clicks or media mentions.
What they're missing is the depth commitment and inter-connection that true fans deliver. Instead of always being on the hunt for one more set of eyeballs, true leaders have figured out that the real win is in turning a casual fan into a true one.
Fans, true fans, are hard to find and precious. Just a few can change everything. What they demand, though, is generosity and bravery. P28/29
A remarkable product or service is like a purple cow. Brown cows are boring; purple ones are worth mentioning. Those ideas spread; those organizations grow. The essence of what's happening in the market today revolves around creating purple cows.
Here's the marketing math:
Ideas that spread, win.
Boring ideas don't spread. Boring organizations don't grow.
Working in an environment that's static is no fun. Even worse, working for an organization that is busy fighting off change is horrible. P38/39
Fear of failure is actually overrated as an excuse. Why?
Because if you work for someone, then, more often than not, the actual cost of the failure is absorbed by the organization, not by you. If your product launch fails, they're not going to fire you. The company will make a bit less money and will move on.
What people are afraid of isn't failure. It's blame. Criticism. We choose not to be remarkable because we're worried about criticism. We hesitate to create innovative movies, launch new human resource initiatives, design a menu that makes diners take notice, or give an audacious sermon because we're worried, deep down, that someone will hate it and call us on it. P39
from David Chang in his New York City kitchen to Nancy Pearl, Seattle's favorite librarian. They re generous. They exist to help the tribe find something, to enable the tribe to thrive. But they understand that the most powerful way to enable is to be statueworthy: by getting out front, by making a point, by challenging convention, and by speaking up. Those are brave acts, and bravery begets statues.
It's easy to hesitate when confronted with the feeling that maybe you're getting too much attention. Great leaders are able to reflect the light onto their teams, their tribes.
Great leaders don't want the attention, but they use it.
They use it to unite the tribe and to reinforce its sense of purpose.
When you abuse the attention, you are taking something from the tribe. When Fidel Castro gave six- or seven-hour-long speeches (with mandatory attendance), he was diminishing the energy of his tribe. When a CEO takes the spoils of royalty and starts acting like a selfish monarch, he's no longer leading. He's taking. P43
The first thing a leader can focus on is the act of tightening the tribe.
It's tempting to make the tribe bigger, to get more members, to spread the word. This pales, however, when juxtaposed with the effects of a tighter tribe. A tribe that communicates more quickly, with alacrity and emotion, is a tribe that thrives.
A tighter tribe is one that is more likely to hear its leader, and more likely still to coordinate action and ideas across the members of the tribe.
Steve Jobs at Apple has tightened the tribe of Apple fanatics in a variety of ways. By creating substantial new products and announcing them online, he's made it a ritual for Apple fanatics to "tune in" to hear what's new. Within hours of a new product announcement, the word has spread to millions or even tens of millions of users-all electronically, all online. At the same time, Apple has enjoyed an interesting side effect of Jobs's obsession with secrecy about new products: online rumor sites and speculation further fuel the conversations among Apple fans. Users will prototype imagined products and share pictures and even dig up obscure patents to prove their points. P44/45
I think, though, it's a mistake to believe that your best tribe recruits are blind sheep. Folks who do nothing but mindlessly follow instructions let you down in two ways.
First, they're not going to do the local leadership required when tribe members interact. They're going to be so busy following the playbook that they'll hesitate about engaging in the interactions that make a tight tribe such a vibrant organization. People don't engage merely to remind one another of the status quo. Instead, they eagerly engage when they want something to improve. This microleadership is essential to the health of your organization.
Second, they're not going to do a very good job of recruiting new members to your tribe. That's because evangelism requires leadership. Leading someone toward giving up one worldview and embracing yours isn't easy and it's not always comfortable. Consider any vibrant group political activ-ists, nonprofit volunteers, or brand fanatics. In each case, it's the microleaders in the trenches and their enthusiastic followers who make the difference, not the honcho who is ostensibly running the group. P48
Through your actions as a leader, you attract a tribe that wants to follow you. That tribe has a worldview that matches the message you're sending.
If you are leading a tribe focused on saving the world by fighting global warming, the tribe will, of course, have a worldview that includes the idea that global warming is a problem and that it can be addressed through its actions.
They come to the tribe with that in mind and your leadership resonates with them.
If, on the other hand, you choose to work to persuade a different group, one with a very different worldview, they will likely reject you. Al Gore started leading his tribe when he didn't know who they were. He stated his message and people found him.
Ultimately, people are most easily led where they wanted to go all along. While that may seem as if it limits your originality or influence, it's true. Fox News didn't persuade millions of people to become conservatives; they just assembled the tribe and led them where they were already headed. P56
Imagine two classrooms with similar teachers. One has fs-teen students, the other, thirty-two. Which group gets a ber-ter education? All other things being equal, the smaller class will always do better. The teacher has more time to spend customizing the lesson to each student. She has fewer students, hence fewer disruptions as well.
Now, flip the experiment around. What if the fifteen students are begrudgingly taking the course as a requirement for graduation, while the thirty-two had to apply to be admitted and are excited to be there. No contest.
Tribes are increasingly voluntary. No one is forced to work for your firm or attend your services. People have a choice of which music to listen to and which movies to watch.
So great leaders don't try to please everyone. Great leaders don't water down their message in order to make the tribe a bit bigger. Instead, they realize that a motivated, connected tribe in the midst of a movement is far more powerful than a larger group could ever be. P57
Leadership almost always involves thinking and acting like the underdog. That's because leaders work to change things, and the people who are winning rarely do.
What we did was (and what you do is) courageous. It requires bravery. Managing doesn't, and following the rules to make a living doesn't. It might be hard work, but it feels safe.
Changing things-pushing the envelope and creating a future that doesn't exist yet (at the same time you're criticized by everyone else-requires bravery.
And over the top? That's easy. Ordinary thinking and ordinary effort are almost never enough to generate leader-ship. That's because our inclination is to do barely enough.
It takes something extraordinary, a call to action that is irresistible, and a cause worth fighting for to make people actually join in.
If you're not over the top, you're not going to have any chance at all of making things happen. P73
Taking a look at the music business is a useful education for any heretic. It demonstrates how exceedingly intelligent people in a fairly new industry willfully ignored the world around them and hid. Those lessons apply to just about every industry you can imagine.
The first rule the music business failed to understand is that, at least at first, the new thing is rarely as good as the old thing was. If you need the alternative to be better than the status quo from the very start, you'll never begin.
Soon enough, the new thing will be better than the old thing. But if you wait until then, it's going to be too late. Feel free to wax nostalgic about the old thing, but don't fool yourself into believing that it's going to be here forever. It won't.
The second rule they missed is that past performance is no guarantee of future success.
Every single industry changes and, eventually, fades.
While you may have made money doing something a certain may yesterday, there's no reason to believe you'll succeed at tomorrow. P79
The music business was built around five pillars:
- Free radio promotion
- A limited number of competing music labels
- The high cost of production, requiring musicians to get financing from labels
- The Top 40 hits-based focus of the baby boomer gen-
eration
- A high-margin, nonreproducible medium (the LP)
Notice that none of these five pillars has anything to do with tribes or leadership.
One by one, each of these five pillars has crumbled over the past five years. The result is that while there is still plenty of music, the music business is in trouble.
The innovation: use digital distribution and the Internet like radio, but do it better. Be in the services/souvenir business, instead of suing customers and yearning for the old days. Find thousands of tribes for thousands of musicians and lead them where they want to go.
The best time to change your business model is while you still have momentum.
It's not so easy for an unknown artist to start from scratch and build a career self-publishing. Not so easy for her to find fans, one at a time, and build an audience. Very, very easy for a record label or a top artist to do so. So the time to jump was yesterday. Too late. Okay, how about today?
The sooner you do it, the more assets and momentum you have to put to work. P80/81
What marketers and organizers and people who care are discovering is that they can ignite a micromovement and then be propelled by the people who choose to follow it.
The key elements in creating a micromovement consist of five things to do and six principles:
1. Publish a manifesto.
Give it away and make it easy for the manifesto to spread far and wide. It doesn't have to be printed or even writ-ten. But it's a mantra and a motto and a way of looking at the world. It unites your tribe members and gives
them a structure.
1. Make it easy for your followers to connect with you.
It could be as simple as visiting you or e-mailing you or watching you on television. Or it could be as rich and complex as interacting with you on Facebook or joining your social network on Ning.
1. Make it easy for your followers to connect with one another.
There's that little nod that one restaurant regular gives to another recognized regular. Or the shared drink in an airport lounge. Even better is the camaraderie developed by volunteers on a political campaign or insiders involved in a new product launch. Great leaders figure out how to make these interactions happen.
1. Realize that money is not the point of a movement.
Money exists merely to enable it. The moment you try to cash out is the moment you stunt the growth of your
movement. 
1. Track your progress.
Do it publicly and create pathways for your followers to contribute to that progress.
Principles:
1. Transparency really is your only option.
Every failed televangelist has learned this the hard way.
The people who follow you aren't stupid. You might go down in scandal or, more likely, from ennui. People can smell subterfuge from a mile away.
1. Your movement needs to be bigger than you.
An author and his book, for example, don't constitute a movement. Changing the way people apply to college does.
1. Movements that grow, thrive.
Every day they get better and more powerful. You'll get there soon enough. Don't mortgage today just because you're in a hurry.
1. Movements are made most clear when compared to the status quo or to movements that work to push the other direction.
Movements do less well when compared to other movements with similar goals. Instead of beating them, join them.
1. Exclude outsiders.
Exclusion is an extremely powerful force for loyalty and attention. Who isn't part of your movement matters almost as much as who is.
1. Tearing others down is never as helpful to a movement are building your followers up. P88/89/90
My colleague Gil likes to quote U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel Honor√©, pointing out that too many people get "stuck on stupid."
I'm imagining that your colleagues aren't stupid. But when the world changes, the rules change. And if you insist on playing today's games by yesterday's rules, you're stuck.
Stuck with a stupid strategy. Because the world changed.
Some organizations are stuck. Others move quickly. In a
changing world, who's having more fun? P97
The Posture of a Leader
If you hear my idea but don't believe it, that's not your fault; it's mine.
If you see my new product but don't buy it, that's my failure, not yours.
If you attend my presentation and you're bored, that's my fault too.  If I fail to persuade you to implement a policy that supports my tribe, that's due to my lack of passion or skill, not your shortsightedness.
If you are a student in my class and you don't learn what
I'm teaching, I've let you down.
It's really easy to insist that people read the manual. It's really easy to blame the user/student/prospect/customer for not trying hard, for being too stupid to get it, or for not caring enough to pay attention. It might even be tempting to blame those in your tribe who aren't working as hard at following as you are at leading. But none of this is helpful.
What's helpful is to realize that you have a choice when you communicate. You can design your products to be easy to use. You can write so your audience hears you. You can present in a place and in a way that guarantees that the people you want to listen will hear you. Most of all, you get to choose who will understand (and who won't). P99/100
Switching Tribes
As your tribe grows, it's tempting to accelerate that growth, to find more people to join the tribe.
The most obvious prospects, of course, are already members of other tribes. If you can persuade that rabid soccer fan to switch to football instead, it's a coup. Or consider the full-page ad in the New York Times paid for by hundreds of evangelical Christians, encouraging religious Jews to switch teams. And there goes a politician, eagerly courting the loudest partisans from the other side to join her team instead. This rarely works.
People don't like to switch. We may eagerly join a company and slog through a job for years, staying until the place finally declares bankruptcy. No, it's not the same company we joined at the beginning, far from it, but to switch sides is to admit that we made a mistake. Growth doesn't come from persuading the most loyal members of other tribes to join you. They will be the last to come around. Instead, you'll find more fertile ground among seekers, among people who desire the feeling they get when they're part of a vibrant, growing tribe, but who are still looking for that feeling.
I'm not talking about disaffected outsiders, loners who work hard not to affiliate. I'm talking about people at the fringes, individuals who might jump from one thing to another with less angst.
If you're trying to persuade the tribe at work to switch from one strategy to the other, don't start with the leader of the opposition. Begin instead with the passionate individuals who haven't been embraced by other tribes yet. As you add more and more people like these, your option becomes safer and more powerful-then you'll see the others join you. P100/101
The curve below shows the benefits of almost any innovation over time:

By the time you realize that your corner of the world is ready for an innovation, it's almost certainly too late. It's definitely not too early.
"It's not time," "Take it easy," "Wait and see," "It's someone else's turn" ‚Äînone of these stalls are appropriate for a leader in search of change. There's a small price for being too early, but a huge penalty for being too late. The longer you wait to launch an innovation, the less your effort is worth. P102
The Forces of Mediocrity
Maybe it should be "the forces for mediocrity."
There's a myth that all you need to do is outline your vision and prove it's right-then, quite suddenly, people will line up and support you.
In fact, the opposite is true. Remarkable visions and genuine insight are always met with resistance. And when you start to make progress, your efforts are met with even more resistance. Products, services, career paths whatever it is, the forces for mediocrity will align to stop you, forgiving no errors and never backing down until it's over.
If it were any other way, it would be easy. And if it were any other way, everyone would do it and your work would ultimately be devalued. The yin and yang are clear: without people pushing against your quest to do something worth talking about, it's unlikely to be worth the journey. Persist. P109
Four million iPhones later (that's more than a billion dollars in less than a year), it's easy to forget that pundit Laura Reis said the Apple phone would never succeed. Visa and Master Card were huge ideas that took years to take off. Even little things, like that restaurant with a line out the door‚Äîit didn't open that way.
If your organization requires success before commitment, it will never have either.
Part of leadership (a big part of it, actually) is the ability to stick with the dream for a long time. Long enough that the critics realize that you're going to get there one way or another ... so they follow. P110

People don't believe what you tell them.
They rarely believe what you show them.
They often believe what their friends tell them.
They always believe what they tell themselves.
What leaders do: they give people stories they can tell themselves. Stories about the future and about change. P117


### Fanocracy
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2020
- **Author**: David Meerman Scott, Reiki Scott

Being a fan builds close connections to others with whom we share interests. The behaviour and its results can be a model for others to mirror. P9
We can be conditioned to view some people as stereotypes of fandom, such as the socially awkward characters depicted on television shows like The Big Bang Theory or Revenge of the Nerds. Many assume fandom is only for those holed up in their basements or starry-eyed teenage girls or the otaku. Are these extremes the only ways to be a fan? Is it true that those who commit their time and effort to what others might consider frivolous hobbies are living less meaningful lives than people who single-mindedly pursue their education and careers?
We have come to the conclusion that too many people limit their own enjoyment of the things they love. Do they worry that pouring their hearts into the activities they enjoy might affect how others see them? Are they afraid of being reduced to a mere stereotype? We all have interests that engage us, and we use these to reach out to others, whether it be a short "Did you watch the game last night?" during your lunch break or an invitation to watch the new Marvel movie release in theaters next weekend. Interests connect us. Fandoms connect us. That's the kind of human connection we crave. P16/17
The algorithms deployed by social networks like Facebook don't show us what we want to see, because the technology favors profit for shareholders rather than the original promise of allowing people to interact with their friends, families, and colleagues. We get tidal waves of spam email and social networks that display advertisements instead of messages from our friends, and fake news instead of what we, as humans, really need to know to lead fulfilling and productive lives.
Worse, scammers have figured out how to game the networks to lure people into partisan content loops to prey on our worst fears and create new ones. While most people understand that a free social network means some loss of privacy, we didn't sign up to have our innermost thoughts, secrets, and notes to ourselves and loved ones stolen and sold to the highest bidder.
The result is a polarizing and cold digital world. Many people now feel that the promise of online social connection just isn't for them anymore-the romance is over. Many people have told us that they have canceled their online presence and opted for privacy they can control themselves. The pendulum has swung too far in the direction of superficial online communications at a time when people are hungry for true human connection. P18
We see the same shift playing out in the world of human communications. We've gone too far into manufactured friendship through social media, and something different is coming next. The pendulum is swinging back to genuine, authentic human connections. P18
In a digital world where our lives are increasingly cluttered and superficial, we're missing something tremendously powerful: genuine human connection. People are going to be most invested in that which creates a sense of intimacy, warmth, and shared meaning in a world that would otherwise relegate them to a statistic. P20
We call this act of consciously bringing people together through a shared endeavor a fanocracy: an organization or person that honors fans and consciously fosters meaningful connections among them. The suffix "-cracy," from the Greek kratos for "rule," is used in popular culture as well as in academia to mean government by a particular sort of people or according to a particular principle. A fanocracy is a culture where fans rule, and that's what we see emerging in today's world. We are moving into an era that prizes people over products. P21
The fundamental ingredient for true fandom-meaningful and active human connection-demonstrates a shift in the way a company relates to its customers. It is more forthright, helpful, and transparent. It creates new experiences by turning customers into like-minded, enthusiastic fans. P21
To be successful in a world where fans rule, we must be convinced that relationships with customers are more important than the products or services we sell to them. Meaningful human connection, the fundamental ingredient for true fandom, can be created by all kinds of different companies, even those who never meet customers in person or speak with them on the telephone. P30
It's up to us to create what we do around whether it brings people together. To succeed, we must become masters of seeing things from other people's points of view and understanding how other people work independently from ourselves. It's a simple yet powerful concept that any organization can implement. The idea of building relationships is an especially valuable ingredient for traditional businesses facing growing competition from the rise of digital products and services. Many analysts and members of the media like to point to online shopping leading to the demise of locally owned stores, and the availability of digital music creating major difficulties for those in the music business, including radio stations and record labels. Yes, digital music platforms are tough to compete against. However, as you can see by now, there are major opportunities to thrive instead of succumbing to what many say is an inevitable digital future. P34/35
Open House Party: The Radio Show That Beats the Playlist
Some traditional industries face competition from new digital products and services so severe that entire businesses are being wiped out. For example, we can purchase air travel, hotel stays, and car rentals with a few clicks, so what does that mean for travel agents? When a quick search shows the exact price of a car, how does a car dealer skilled at haggling cope? With new ways to consume music, movies, and books, how can existing providers adapt so they don't become extinct? John Garabedian, the creator and host for thirty years of Open House Party, a live show syndicated on hundreds of radio stations as well as available via web streaming around the world, told us, "With music streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Beats to compete with, radio needs to offer something more than just songs to be sticky' to compete and attract and hold a huge audience." Virtually every major star in the world has been on Open House Party over the years, including Madonna, Eminem, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry. The essence of the show is a big Saturday night party with music stars joining a small live audience in the studio and listeners calling in live to be a part of the action. Tuning in, listeners hear from the artists, experience the excitement of the audience, and learn about what's hot from the listener requests coming in live on the phone and the web. For many music fans, the excitement of Open House Party is much more fun than simply listening to a playlist on a streaming service because of the interaction with other like-minded people. The direction of each show is totally driven by fans because all the music played on Open House Party is by listener request. This keeps the show tuned in to what people actually want to hear on Saturday nights. This direct connection with fans means Open House Party spots hot new hits first, identifies which songs are the most popular, and, almost as important, determines which songs have died and people have grown tired of hearing. "Unlike music streaming services that just play tunes, radio needs to sound compelling and fun so that people don't just 'listen' to a show or a station, they actually love a show or a station," Garabedian says. "Great radio gives listeners reasons to be loyal. Outstanding stations attract fans, not just listeners." Garabedian built a fanocracy of millions of music lovers coming together, listening to Open House Party on hundreds of radio stations on Saturday nights. Sure, they may listen to their own playlists on the digital streaming services during the week, but when they want to party on Saturday nights, they tune in. Rather than give up in the face of stiff competition from online services, people like Garabedian devise ways to build relationships directly with fans. The human connection brings loyalty. For the music fans devoted to Open House Party, music is much more than just the product (the songs). Music is engaging with others like themselves to enjoy the lifestyle that music and conversation about music bring. By finding ways to gather people together in live, shared consumption of a product, companies can connect with their fans in ways that digital solutions cannot. P35/36/37
While many companies falsely think that their job is to facilitate a transaction and to do so at as low of a cost as possible, your job is to create fandom. Your transition from transaction to fandom is especially powerful when you are dealing with stiff competition that offers products similar to yours. When others are simply selling products, you succeed by creating lasting relationships with those who will become lifelong fans. It requires a genuine interest in your customers, anticipating their needs and wants. P42
At that performance, the crowd went wild, the show was named as a standout by Rolling Stone, and many people shared on social media because of a simple but frequently overlooked dynamic in our digital age: physical proximity. Suddenly I realized this was a factor I needed to examine more closely. It occurred to me that fandom is a result of doing what you love, and if you bring forth that passion and share with others, it's possible to create an organizational phenomenon: fanocracy. Bringing that concept into my talks has been overwhelmingly favorable. People want to share their experiences, and what better place to begin than at work? That's the first place people share where they went over the holiday, on the weekend, or the night before. It's that sharing that creates a common bond, and in some cases, you can introduce someone else to a band, play, opera, or game they might never have been curious about but for your shared enthusiasm. P49
If we want to be effective in our communications, we need to learn how to consciously manage the physical space between ourselves and others. It's not just a matter of being close or far, or that the closer we get the better it is. Rather, the significance of each level of proximity can be precisely predicted and managed so as to create the most optimal outcomes. Hall described "public distance" as more than twelve feet away from others, a distance that lacks any sense of precise interaction among those involved. He identified "social distance" for interactions among acquaintances as being from four feet to twelve feet, "personal distance" for interactions among good friends or family from about a foot and a half to four feet, and anything closer as "intimate distance" for embracing, touching, or whispering. The most rewarding interactions in our lives occur in our social and personal spaces. Those people sitting near one another at a game or at Starbucks or who are standing near one another in a line at a movie theater or live music show? They're well within each other's social space, and as such each person can unconsciously feel the human connection in a positive and safe way. P50/51
"The work of Dr. Hall is incredibly important because one of the things we're just coming to learn now, thanks to neuroscience, is whenever human beings get together in any kind of situation in the same physical space, their unconscious minds track the locale of every other person in that space even if they can't see them," Dr. Nick Morgan told us. Morgan is president of Public Words, a communications consulting company, and the author of Power Cues: The Subtle Science of Leading Groups, Persuading Others, and Maximizing Your Personal Impact.
Morgan's work on how humans interact parallels how fandom cultures form and grow-and how important these bonds are to each of us. "We‚Äôre a species that wants to get together in groups of friends, of people that we feel safe with, a tribe, and we want to share our emotions," Morgan says. "We're happiest when we‚Äôre in social space or personal space with people and we‚Äôre all experiencing some kind of emotion. We're laughing together or we're crying together. It's why-even in an era when you can watch a football game much more intelligently and closely and clearly and certainly more comfortably on a giant TV screen like many of us have in our homes-people still go to the football stadium. They want to experience the thrill of the shared emotion and excitement. The closer you get within those four zones‚Äî for example, from public to social and from social to personal-the more powerful the shared emotions are. That kind of group sharing of emotion is incredibly important to humans and it's been widely misunderstood and underrated by people who have subscribed to individualistic notions of humanity."
People don't want to be alone; they want to be together. Take note of what Morgan teaches us. The closer you get, the more powerful the shared emotions are. The significance of proximity isn't just a matter of convenience or utility, but rather the emotional significance of any given exchange. We're wired as humans to have more emotionally significant responses to people we're close to. And whether we're twelve feet, four feet, or even one and a half feet apart leads to decidedly different emotions. A fan is who they are not because of a calculated, intellectual decision to follow something, but because of their passion, their emotion, and their sense of enjoyment. To successfully build a fan base out of whatever it is you're doing for a living, or if you want to sell or market a product or service, begin to think of creative ways to develop and cultivate human connections. Remember the importance of proximity because that can lead you to a better understanding of how to attract and keep potential fans interested in your products or services. P52/53
A music festival becomes an instant city filled with like-minded people enjoying the same music and being near one another. While waiting for a show to start, we spontaneously form a community, striking up conversations with those around us, secure in the knowledge that we have instant rapport because we share the same interest, and the conversation is smooth and natural, as if we've been friends for a long time. Someone asks, "Have you seen St. Vincent before? What was it like?" Another may join in: "Have there been any other standout performances today? Who are you going to see tomorrow?" It's not surprising that the live music business is thriving. While CD sales are in decline and revenues from streaming haven't kept up, Live Nation Entertainment, one of the world's largest live entertainment companies, which operates concert promotions, venues, and ticketing, has seen revenue steadily climb for the past decade from $3.6 billion per year in 2007 to over $10 billion in 2017. P54
Normally, when we attend a typical stage performance such as theater, dance, music, or stand-up comedy, we're usually in the "public space" of the performer, a distance of twelve feet or more. At those distances, neuroscientists say, our unconscious brain does not track people to learn if they are friend or foe. We don't have or feel a strong personal connection when we're so far away. While public distance is inclusive of as little as twelve feet, more often with larger stage performances the distance might be one hundred feet or more. In other contexts of daily life such as a walk in a park, there are likely to be many people within our public space, but they might as well be hundreds or thousands of feet away from us, because our unconscious mind doesn't pay close attention to them. The experiences we share with those nearer than twelve feet away, as you can now see, is quite significant. Building fandom-whether you're an artist, CEO, entrepreneur, manager, politician, teacher, parent, spouse, friend, or other role that involves gaining a closer relationship with others‚Äîrequires figuring out ways to have other people less than twelve feet away, even if only for a few moments. P57
Mirroring and Your Fans
So far in this chapter we've looked at the importance of proximate human connection in growing a fan base. People go to live music for more than the show; they go to enjoy close proximity with other people like them. Steve Cohen built a successful career as a magician by building his show so that every member of the audience has a personal connection directly with him, and those audience members tell their friends about how great the experience was, He's performed over five thousand shows and never needs to advertise. We explored how the entire recreational vehicle industry came together to more than double the market for new RVs in a decade by appealing to people's desire to camp in groups. And we spoke with a teenage egg entrepreneur who meets personally with customers and has become remarkably successful as a result.
Let's face it, we humans are hardwired to react to those who are nearby. Our evolution has taught us to unconsciously track those who come near us in order to quickly determine if they are good or harmful, Because these basic instincts are so powerful, when we are close to many people we don't know, like on a subway platform, for example, we're wary. We can't help that response, it's built into all of us. We‚Äôre preparing to flee or to fight if presented with any sign of danger. However, when we are in close proximity to people we trust, a personal connection develops. People who cultivate that closeness, bringing customers within a social distance of fewer than twelve feet or a personal distance of fewer than four feet, create strong emotional bonds, and that can create fans. How can businesses and artists who can't possibly have a direct personal connection with every fan achieve similar success? It turns out that if you perform in front of thousands of people or if your product is used by millions of consumers, you can still use the power of connection. Our unconscious brain can respond to what we see as if it were our own experience, even if it is on social media, film, a screen, or a faraway stage through something called mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are a group of cells in the premotor cortex and inferior parietal cortex of our brain. These neurons are fascinating because they not only activate when we perform an action-biting into an apple, smiling, or getting near to somebody we enjoy being with‚Äî they also fire when we observe somebody else performing the same action. When those around us are happy and smiling, our unconscious brain tells us we're happy, and we often smile too. When we're at a rock concert, our mirror neurons fire based on what the performer is doing onstage and what other audience members are doing. I speak at conferences dozens of times a year, often to groups of a thousand people or more. There's no possible way I can bring each person onto the stage to have him or her be within my personal space the way that Steve Cohen does. Yet it turns out that we humans respond to seeing somebody else having an experience as if it were us. I make it a point to come down from the stage into the audience to interact with a few people in their seats several times during each of my talks. I'm purposefully getting into the personal space of just a few members of the audience, but because of their brains' mirror neurons, others in the audience can feel my presence. Dr. Nick Morgan, whom we met earlier, says it's like the ripples of a stone being dropped into a pond. "You can genuinely move, touch, and share emotions with everybody in that audience simply by connecting with one or two people. If you move into the audience and ask a question or get a comment, stand next to a person, shake hands with them, interact with them in some way, then your whole audience feels interacted with and the room suddenly becomes very small and intimate.‚Äù P68/69/70
It turns out that mirroring is not just about those directly across from you. An important aspect of mirroring is that the brain fires even when the other person is far away, like during my speeches, or even a virtual presence on a screen. This mirroring helps to explain both the positive and the negative aspects of social media. We can relate to people via images on their Facebook and Instagram posts. Our brain tells us we're close to them because of the photographs or the video they share. Perhaps that's why social networking posts with photos and videos of people tend to have many more social interactions than those with just plain text, and more interaction such as likes and shares than those with photos and videos that don't feature people. There are many mirroring processes going on when it comes to social media and it certainly facilitates an understanding," lacoboni says. "When I see you posting something on a social network, especially on visual networks like Instagram or Facebook, it triggers in my brain all sorts of imaginative processes, so I can understand you from a more human standpoint, not just based on the things you're saying. However, when there is no face-to-face connection on social media, people lose that magical connection and that makes it easier for people to get into an antagonistic way of relating to other people.* As a live music enthusiast, I have been fascinated with how the science of mirroring helps to explain why I am passionate about going to concerts. What lacoboni said reminded me of the time a few years ago when I was dozens of rows away from the stage at a Rolling Stones show, and a simple hand slap that Mick lagger shared with a lucky fan far away from me lit me up too! Apparently, as lacoboni suggests, the mirror neurons in my brain reacted as if lagger had given me a high five. It was an unforgettable part of that show! P71
"An artist can't get close to everybody in the audience," lacoboni says. "But just being close to some audience members builds a sense of oneness between those people who are close and those farther back. Members of the audience fill the gap between the artist and them in terms of distance and space, and when we see a performance, we can imagine the musicians performing the music and empathize with them and mirror neurons are very important for this. To be a more successful artist requires a process that includes both a bottom-up imagination that you mirror your own fans and what they like and then transform that into a top-down plan for transforming your act in a way that will lead your followers." A critical aspect of understanding mirror neurons is to remember that it's how we're hardwired. It's our ancient brain at work helping us to cope with the world around us. It's not something we can choose to turn on or choose to ignore. It's innate. We can't help ourselves to react in the way that we do. P72
The selfie demonstrates something significant to us because of the orientation of our bodies when we snap a photo. While the two (or more) heads are typically well within intimate space, the subjects of the photo are actually facing the same direction. We are in intimate space because we have to get our heads close together. However, because we're oriented in the same direction, we're aligned. This alignment becomes a powerful expression of wanting the same thing as that other person-even if it's only for a fleeting moment.
Some see a selfie as frivolous and childish, but that's outdated thinking. Selfies are a very powerful and immediate way to share emotion. Imagine if two people who didn't trust each other were a foot and a half away. If they were facing each other, they would likely feel awkward or threatened. But when two or more people face the same direction, such as looking at a camera, it's acceptable. The humble selfie breaks the intimate proximity barrier! It is safe and enjoyable. P74
In any type of creation-personal or professional-the greatest insight is gained from seeing it from another person's point of view. P84
What makes this comic so popular? Ukazu seems to have found that perfect point between engaging with her fan base and letting it drive on its own. She's tapped into the sort of story that my generation is yearning for-filled with LGBT characters, people of color, mental illness, fluffy romances, and humor. She also listens to and understands that her work inspires creative energy in others, and so she encourages it.
Ukazu takes a multimedia approach to her creation as well as her interaction with fans. She posts her comic on her website while simultaneously blogging responses to fans and updates on her Tumblr and keeping an in-world Twitter account "run" by Bitty himself over the span of the comic's timeline. Fans can interact with each of these aspects of her world as they please, reblogging or retweeting or commenting on what she has posted. "The stories that developed and the reader interaction added an extra layer of narrative to the webcomic and made people feel like Bitty was real," Ukazu says in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. The heartwarming story set up in this in-leractive fashion made the Check, Please! fandom grow fast. On Archive of Our Own there are more than six thousand works and growing with more art and other fan works on other platforms like Tumblr and Twitter. P87
Ukazu says on Den of Geek that finding her "healthy relationship" with fandom took time to accomplish. "My biggest advice for creators is to leave fandom alone. Appreciate it, but don't try to control it. Simi-larly, readers should understand that headcanons might never be canon and the story and characters belong to the creator. End of story.
The relationship starts to deteriorate when one party tries to control the other." P88
When fans take ownership, it doesn't mean that they take away power from the creators, because it isn't a zero-sum game. Rather, by transforming and adding their layers of understanding, fans are expanding the scope of the original work, propelling it further, reaching far more people than it could have reached before. P91
Curative fandom is what most people are comfortable with. In fact, it is the focus of heavy marketing from in-dustries. It's the accumulated knowledge and physical medium of a work‚Äîthe trivia, the action figures, the baseball cards, the tell-all autobiographies ‚Äîthat define curative fandom. On the other hand, there are many other car enthusiasts who love the transformative category of car fandom. They build hot rods by starting with a base car, stripping it down, and building it back up as something far different from the stock model vehicle they started with.
For example, the long-standing lowrider communities in Southern California disassemble and create something beautiful, traditionally from Chevrolets. However, that auto transformation has nothing to do with what the powers that be at Chevy say or do. This is what is called transformative fandom. These fans take inspiration from one work that moved them to create something new-they transform it. For cars, this means building and modifying, yet it can take many forms, such as fan fiction, fan art, fan-edited videos, parody songs, and many others.
Understanding the different ways these fans choose to interact with the source material is key to any business. Neither curative nor transformative fandom is superior, but each has different needs. Often, curative fandom is what companies understand, and indeed the only aspect of fandom they market to, but being able to tap into both can be much more powerful. P92
This transformative way of interacting with media is not new. Roland Barthes, French philosopher, linguist, and critic, wrote an essay in 1967 entitled "The Death of the Author." (In fact, in the original French, la mort de l'auteur is a pun on Le morte d'Arthur, referencing another piece of literary fan fiction, Sir Thomas Malory's Arthurian tales.) In this essay, Barthes argues against the prevailing mode of criticism at the time that put the author at the center of the conversation. Instead, he insists that the meaning of a text does not come from the author. The author loses control of meaning as soon as the work is out in the public because as each reader has a different background, each brings their own context to interpret the work. Meaning is what comes from personal reactions to words on a page. P93
Meaning comes from a web of influence rather than one static idea.
It comes from thinking both about the CGI and the feminism in Game of Thrones. Fandom is one way of sharing our infinite meanings or distinct interpretations of creative works with one other, thus shaping our readings of the canon. We use fan works as a way of communicating our meaning, or interpretation, of what we enjoy with other fans‚Äî a narrative form of literary analysis. Just like Lin-Manuel Miranda shared his reading of American history through a lens of immigration and race, lesser known fans posting stories on Archive of Our Own share their own readings using the lenses through which they see the world. The environment of sharing is to everyone's benefit as it deepens and morphs our own understanding of the media we love by seeing it through one another's eyes. P93/94
Because many people in the fan fic community can't find stories that represent who they are in traditional media, they write their own. It was common in fandom to portray Hermione Granger from Harry Potter as black far before the English actress Noma Dumezweni was cast for the stage production Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The desire for stories about queer relationships is one of the driving factors of the multitude of gay romance fan fiction. Fandom is where many people from marginalized communities can control their own consumption of media, transforming it to make it a more enjoyable and nuanced experience. When the majority of what we watch is from a male perspective, online communities give us an outlet to subvert those cultural narratives. Like Lin-Manuel Miranda, we take the works we love and create works that reflect our points of view. Letting go is a technique that we can use in all businesses and professions to build a fanocracy, because fan ownership of ideas is a powerful tool to spread the work. The professional also gains the most valuable feedback process ever created-the ability to see what their creation looks like from someone who has lived a completely different life. P94/95
The three basics to building a strong fan base are the same:
1. Know your audience.
1. Give your communities the correct resources and space.
1. Always treat your customers as humans.
"Always start with your audience. The who dictates the how, where, when, and why," says Vanessa DiMauro. She is the CEO of Leader Net-works, a strategic research and consulting firm that helps companies use digital and social technologies to gain competitive advantage. "Too often, organizations pile on the content when they're building a com-munity. They shove everything they've got into it and never think about the humans who will use it. That never goes well." P101
From the very start, when building a community, DiMauro says organizations need to bring customers into the creative process. "There must be an involved group of core members-ambassadors or friends of the firm-that partner pretty heavily with the organization in the social design of the community." These early engaged users will model behavior on communication, knowledge, and collaboration to set the tone and culture. Then, the company must slowly transfer authority and agency to the community. As DiMauro explains, "The goal is to move from 'sage on the stage' to 'guide on the side? You can't let the community completely run itself, because members don't have the backend data and knowledge. The ideal state is when the organization that sponsors the community acts on behalf of the community while balancing the goals of their organization."
DiMauro categorizes core members of online business communities into three different types according to what drives them: First, the experts. These members are often consultants or tech wizards who enjoy sharing what they know because it will build their own businesses.
Second are the connectors. These members are professionals and devotees who are in the community for the interaction and camaraderie.
Third, the disenfranchised. These members come to the platform only to solve a problem they can't solve on their own.
Understanding how each of these three different groups contributes to online interaction will allow your company to establish a stable, helpful community. According to DiMauro, "When brands design to understand their customer, to solve their problems, to meet their needs, to delight them on every front they can within reason, then the outcome will almost invariably be customer loyalty and advocacy.‚Äù In the past, marketing departments were charged with being the voice of the customer. The company was always in control of the mes-sage, and agency was taken away from the consumer. With online communities and public forums, this is no longer the case. If marketing professionals cling to the old ways by charging themselves with being the voice of the customer, they will miss what really matters to their fans. P102/103
Letting go doesn't always work the way the creators, or other fans, want. This extends to policing what is said in these communities.
DiMauro says companies have to step back. "The only true communities are the ones where people can say whatever they want," she says.
"Once organizations breach trust and eliminate the social capital of the community, then people stop talking. To succeed, you've got to create a safe space." P104
If our digital disconnect is the problem, doing what that surfer did for me that day offers a simple and powerful opportunity. We break transactional patterns by doing the opposite of what's expected. P111
The Grateful Dead gave away their music in the same way as the Hawaiian surfer gave me the wave, with no expectation of something in return. Fandom is built on human connection, and when you're given something of value completely free and with no obligation, you tend to share your appreciation with others. Fans copied and shared countless millions of Grateful Dead recordings when each of them passed on the gift of a cassette tape or download link to other fans. And all of this led back to the band that made it happen. P113
Gifts build fans and result in people sharing on social media and in person to their friends. A gift is often so unexpected that we can't help but feel compelled to talk about it. P125
The way older children and teenagers introduce themselves into adult-hood, out of the spotlight and within their own time, is with their identity around the things they enjoy. Their fandoms. The graphics of rock bands they wear on their T-shirts, the makeup tutorials they choose to follow, or the online forums they join are all more than what they seem from the outside. Sometimes, an initiation rite can include an element of perceived danger such as a first LSD experience in hippie culture. They are today's modern, self-directed rites of passage.
They are the way young people show us what sort of adults they are becoming.
In our research for this book, we asked several thousand people who identified a fandom they were involved with at what age they started to become interested in that subject. The median age of the responses was twelve years old. Isn't it interesting that age twelve is also the  same time we face new responsibilities and new challenges? Does that feel familiar? We develop new bodies and new hormones. Adversity seems to show up at that age more than it did before, in both what others expect of us and what we expect from ourselves. School, bullies, peer pressure, and friendships all suddenly seem so much bigger or more intense than we had previously faced. Consciously forming an identity was an answer to that because it offered us a source of stability in an otherwise intimidating world.
We build, piece by piece, our identities using both family tradition and pop culture references. And still, even after decades of identity building, those early steps into adulthood formed the basis of who we would become. Those brands and experiences stay with us. P130/131
For Spartz, creating and managing MuggleNet was his vehicle into adulthood-into the fandom he'd be a part of his whole life, as well as his career. It was a way of taking something he liked, these books he'd read over and over again, and making it his. "When you passively read something, you're stepping into a universe that somebody else created. You're making a copy of yourself and that copy exists in the form of a character. You become Harry and you save the world," he told us. "But when you participate in the creation of the world, you are taking ownership of the idea, the content, yourself. Like in business, getting stock in a company creates ownership and thus makes people want to work harder to grow the value of the business. Participating in the creation of content around a world can make you feel like an owner." P133
through pop culture because he understands that people give emotional weight to decisions that are tied to their identity.
To many young people, what bands they listen to, what clothing they wear, and what celebrities they follow on social networks are ways to show others who they are. Even the most mundane decisions about what products teens choose can be shaped by personal story. P155
"Some brands can indicate cool status, or counterculture status.
Brands, whether they're technology, consumer, or retail, play a huge role in the adolescent life in that they are used to communicate identity-how they see themselves and their place in the world." So what is the difference between a brand that is successful among Gen Z and one that fails? Inniss says it's about knowing that brands have a power to mean more and using that platform to their advantage.
Especially in socially responsible ways. "There's a recent Nielsen survey where 72 percent of the teenage cohort said they were willing to pay more for products and services that were committed to positive social or environmental impact," Inniss says. "There's a sense of tightened social awareness that is undercurrent, that is a theme, to Generation Z." How does this expand to all fanocracies? A shoe can become more than a shoe because it means something to the individual in their life outside the product. A certain product means that kids know what's cool or they follow or try to mirror certain celebrities. A shoe itself tells a story about the wearer. In the same way, many young people choose brands that are socially conscious because they know it will reflect back on them, as if to say, *I chose this brand because I want to be seen as caring about the environment." It carries weight in decision making because it reflects how these young people think of themselves and how they want to be seen by others. P136/137
No matter how it manifests within a company or professional, what matters is understanding that stories have a value in themselves. What brands can learn from Rosewater's insight is that developing products that value flexibility-the capacity for each individual to take a mass-produced product and somehow make it their own-pays enormous dividends as those individuals continually invest in and trust the brand. They become fans because-even though the product is mass produced-they are able to assign emotional weight to decisions about how they use the product. Providing room for the individual to incorporate a product into their lives is a quality that will make it successful because people care about expressing themselves as individuals. P140
When customers have the opportunity to establish an emotional bond with others as a result of doing business with you, it sticks. They feel compelled to experience it again and tell others about the fantastic experience you gave them. Ultimately, this is what will inspire passion and build your own fanocracy. P148
Beyond the Transaction: When organizations set out to provide a product or service, they typically make the crucial mistake of believing that they are only there to provide that product or service‚Äîas if they were merely there to fulfill a transaction. Is this the fastest, biggest, cheapest? Why should I buy your product instead of the other company's offering? Frequently, a focus on product attributes results in a race to the bottom with price discounts and shoddy service. This is not a way to build a fanocracy. In a world where breaking through the clutter of competitive offerings presents a challenge to organizations of all kinds, we see many attempts to stand out in the opposite way as well‚Äînot with discounts, but by offering extra perks, upgraded service, and enhanced products. But such approaches are usually just a bit of bling on top of a standard offering. These kinds of business models don't lead to creating fanoc-racies either. That's because typical consumers don't see the enhancement as something special or unique. Instead, they assume they are paying for the entire offering inclusive of the "extra." They see through the bribe. Been there, done that. P164
ple, where it's impossible for people to participate this way, allow fans to be a part of the creation process? It turns out that technology can play a huge role in bringing fans closer to artists.
Consider the British rock band Coldplay and their use of LED wristbands at their shows. Upon entry to the venue, each fan is handed a Xylobands wristband, a radio-controlled system that's run by the band's production crew. Multiple flash patterns are programmed on the full-color LEDs on every audience member's wristband to create a light show that every fan is a part of. Fans love them because the audience comes together as one with the artist to create a single, flashing, colorful organism.
Similar effects can be programmed to work on smartphones that people can hold in the air to be part of a show, a technology used by American electronic musician Dan Deacon. While the smartphone technology Deacon uses is less expensive than Coldplay's purchase of tens of thousands of wristbands for each show, fans must download the app ahead of time to be a part of the fun.
It's particularly fitting for Deacon because he is renowned by fans for his live shows. Reiko and I attended a Deacon show at Lollapalooza in Chicago a few years ago where he had nearly the entire audience throwing empty water bottles in the air at particular times, making fans a major element of the performance. Even though we saw a few dozen acts that weekend, one of the most memorable for us was Deacon's because he had us participating in creating the fun. We were an active part of the show!
During Coldplay's famous anthem "Yellow," everyone's wristbands light up, you guessed it, yellow! Most of the time the wristbands are dark, but during peak moments in the show, such as in the middle of
"Charlie Brown," lead singer Chris Martin tells fans, "Put your hands in the air!" and a stadium full of wrists sync to the song he's singing.
Just like the way a handful of customers come together for four days to build wooden surfboards, tens of thousands of Coldplay fans come together for a few hours, and the wristbands make everybody a part of the show. When people participate in this way, the bonds create a fanocracy.
"Coldplay showed me how important the fan experience is, it's fan to fan," Nate Tepper told us. Tepper is the CEO and cofounder of Har-mony, an app that empowers fans to vote on songs they want to hear at upcoming concerts. "In a sea of seventy thousand people, everyone is lighting up the same color at the same beat and I've never felt more connected to seventy thousand people. It was emotional and powerful to be one with the band and the music. I didn't even need to look at the band onstage to feel that. It's cooler to look at the lights because each light is another human being." P176/177
right then to solve the favorite song problem, so he created Harmony. Hundreds of artists, including Taylor Swift, U2, Ed Sheeran, Beyonc√©, Muse, Tim McGraw, and Matchbox Twenty, use Harmony to communicate directly with fans. Harmony has a partnership with Ticketmaster where fans who purchase tickets are emailed a link to help create a set list, and then the bands share the link through social networks including Facebook and Instagram. Fans are taken to a unique Harmony page for each show and can vote on what songs should be played.
Fans can also upvote their favorite songs for a small fee, and the money from each vote goes to charities supporting homelessness, autism, suicide prevention, and cancer research. The more fans vote, the better the chance the artist will play their requested songs and the bigger the social impact. Some people vote dozens or in a few cases hundreds of times, yet fans only pay if the artist plays their chosen song.
The song request concept links fans to artists. When fans are empowered by influencing the set list, they take part in developing the show and feel a personal connection with the artist that they don't otherwise have. Fans take the time preshow to choose songs, and when an artist actually does play that song the fan chose, it gives a powerful jolt at the concert. The fan thinks, I did this. I helped make that song hap-pen! That's especially true when the artist thanks fans for voting, as some do from the stage.
"We survey fans after shows and they tell us that when the artist plays their favorite song, they feel like they were a part of creating the experience," Tepper says. "It's amazing for them, like a direct line to the artist where you can influence the set list and the artist listens.
Some fans tell us stories of why a song means so much to them and how they ended up getting to that show. It might be a couple and it's their wedding song. When the artist actually plays the song that they wanted to hear it's a moment of pure joy, a true moment of connection between an artist and a fan."
Artists love Harmony too, because when somebody uses the app to select an artist's song, that person's email address is shared with the artist so they can include it in their mailing list and connect more closely with fans. That's important because the ticketing companies don't share fan contact information with artists.
As I was writing this, I received an email from Ticketmaster with the subject line "What If Jack White Played All Your Favorite Songs?" The email was from Ticketmaster based on my purchase of Jack White tickets, and the link pointed to the Harmony app. I chose a few songs including "Lazaretto," "Temporary Ground, and "Sixteen Saltines" for Jack White to play. A week or so later I was at the show. I was excited when White and his band kicked into "Laza-retto" as the second song of the show and later on played "Sixteen Sal-tines." Just by choosing the songs on the Harmony app, I felt more connected to White. It made me feel a little bit like an insider, even though thousands of others might have selected the same songs! –ù–∞!
Feelings trump reality every time! P178/179/180
The issue is, it is almost impossible for us to undo this sort of "logi-cal framing" once it occurs. When we strip people of their personalities and mark them instead as mere tasks or objects to be handled, we miss key data points. We misdiagnose and alienate. We degrade any trust that might have existed. And then, inevitably, our work with them suffers. We assume we know more about them than they do themselves, ignoring any protest or disagreement.
Over the course of my training as a medical student, I've grown used to answering multiple-choice questions, each with one correct answer. The single best thing to do. But Henry rejected that "correct" answer because it didn't fit his own personal story.
Henry was right, of course, for him. His response made me look more closely at the world around me. Where else do we need to remember that we are not robots? Where else do we have to know ourselves as clearly as Henry to make bold decisions that maybe no one but ourselves will understand? P190
Your customers have lives beyond their digital footprint, and once you learn more about them, you inspire loyalty. P191
As a consumer, do you sometimes feel like communications automation has made life difficult? Or like you're just another email address unknowingly added to a list of untold millions of others? You can shout as loud as you want into a satisfaction survey, but do you feel you are being heard? So what do you do?
You might decide, like our New Jersey grill aficionado who takes
pride in his cherished cookouts, to move on to the next brand.
What do all of these numbers, lists, and facts mean to you? Does it feel as though companies have turned you and your family into an abstraction? Have they separated themselves from the you that is your story? This is the process of dehumanization, depriving you of your ability to have thoughts or feelings of your own.
In short, technology cannot re-create the emotional weight of decisions made by a person who's spent their entire life forming their own personal story.
That essential piece will always be missing when the digital dominates the experience. The only way to reverse the trend is by learning how to explore the emotional significance of the decision that clients have to make through understanding their stories.
That's where narrative comes in. P193
A fandom business is human centered instead of data obsessed. P203


### Marketing Lessons From The Grateful Dead
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2010
- **Author**: David Meerman Scott, Brian Halligan

Because the concert tours themselves were the main source of revenue, the Grateful Dead ran their concerts in a very different way from other bands. For example, each show had a unique set of songs, and each song was played in a unique way, giving fans a strong incentive to see the show for several nights in a row (or weeks, months, or years), because every night you were treated to a different musical experience. This is the exact opposite approach to that taken by other bands. P4
 Each day, Rue La La features a designer boutique, say Villeroy & Boch or St. John, that opens at 11:00 A.M. Eastern and remains open for 48 hours or until merchandise sells out, with a blinking clock counting down the time. Because merchandise can sell out in a matter of minutes, members often set calendar reminders so that they can be at their computers a few minutes before 11:00 A.M. The company sends out e-mail reminders a few days in advance that let people know which designers will be featured on the site.
Since its inception in April 2008, Rue La La has built a passionate fan base of 1.6 million members using viral methods. To become a member, you must receive an invitation from another member. Once a member extends an invitation, he or she receives a $10 credit when each friend places their first order, with no limit placed on the number of credits one can receive. Credits can then be used against any boutique purchase. P7
CREATE YOUR OWN LANDSCAPE
Products that are highly differentiated can still succeed today, but it's much harder to win if your business model is the same as your com-petitors'.
Your job is to do research about your industry in order to build
a killer business model. You want to break free from the competitive landscape and create a cascade of unique benefits for your customers.
ACTION: Creating a unique business model is very difficult and no free lunch exists on how to do it. Rather than tell you how to create a unique business model in your industry, we thought we would give you some hard questions to ask yourself that will get your juices flowing about how to create one:
What are you three times better at than your competitors? What are you three times worse at than your competitors? If the answer is "noth-ing" to both, you are not unique enough to really break out. And no, you can't be better than your competition in all dimensions-you need to rethink the dimensions.
What new technology is emerging that might enable you to upset your industry's apple cart? Could the Internet be a new distribution channel? Could an iPad application catapult you past the competition? Could you use Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) system (an online arena that connects those who have relatively small tasks with people who can perform them) to dramatically lower costs or deliver new value?
Are there societal changes happening that you might take advantage of in your industry, such as empty nesters moving back into cities, more people working from home, a shift to outsourcing to rural America rather than overseas, or increased interest in low-carbon-footprint lifestyles for companies and families, and so on?
Do you have someone who's really smart from outside your industry whom you can ask to help you with this? The problem with creating a unique business model in an industry you grew up in is that you naturally get bogged down in the same industry assumptions that you're trying to break. P9/10
A name like the Grateful Dead is an asset to an organiza-tion. When you select an uncommon name (and one appropriate to your company image and target market) it's unlikely that consumers will confuse your product with something similar. They will remember you. And in today's world of online communications and of search engines, unique names for your company, products, and services allow you to own the search engine results for your brands. Most companies don't focus enough attention on choosing a memorable name or on the importance of Google, Bing, and other search engines when selecting those names. Typically people closest to the product development effort are the ones proposing the candidate names. This usually leads to overly technical names focused on what a product does (something like "MP3 Deluxe Pocket Player" rather than a memorable name that appeals to customers, like "iPod"). P15
FIND YOUR MEMORABLE NAME
Naming is tough. But it is a very important element of marketing. Most organizations don't spend enough time on this important activity.
ACTION: Here are some things to keep in mind and a few tricks you might try as you think of a name:
- Avoid common names and names that are already used as a title of a popular movie or book. You will want to have a name that shows up as the top listing for search results in the search engines and social media sites.
- Use search engines before finalizing a name. You don't want to fall in love with a name that doesn't yield the top search results.
- Find inspiration in unlikely places. Why not go to one of the online booksellers (such as Amazon.com, BN.com, or Borders.com) and search the name of the category of product you are trying to name.
You'll see a list of book titles and subtitles that may spark an idea.
- Many people choose made-up words as a name. This is great because you can own the search results. But try not to choose one that is too esoteric or difficult to pronounce if you go this route.
- You might take two words that are very different and put them together as one word, like SurveyMonkey, an intriguing company name.
- Try an alternative spelling for a word. "Google" is derived from the word "googol," a number that is 10 to the power of 100 (the numeral one followed by 100 zeros). "Flickr" is "flicker" with the "e" removed.
- In her excellent book POP!, Sam Horn talks about what she calls
"alphabetizing" common words to come up with a name. We like this technique. Take a product you want to name, for example, yogurt in a squeeze tube. Then go through every letter in the alphabet and substitute it for the "y" in yogurt, and presto: "GoGurt" is born.
- Take a common name and change it slightly to create a new word. For example, the name of the social networking site FledgeWing is derived from the word "fledgling." P18/19
RETHINK THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT
Does your marketing team look like everyone else's? Is your marketing organization set up the same way as that of your last company? Is your marketing organization full of "generalist project manager" types aho have heavily overlapping skill-sets? If so, it's time for a change in organization, some new skills development, and new blood (Le., Julia
Poy -style).
ACTION: Organize your marketing team in this way. You want someone responsible for "getting found" (filling the top of your funnel), someone responsible for "converting" the folks who are getting pulled in, and someone responsible for "analyzing" the numbers and helping you make better decisions.
Try to diversify the skill-set in your marketing department and fill in the gaps by hiring or training folks to be digital citizens ("convert team"), who are highly analytical ("analyze team"), have deep market reach ("get found team") and/or are natural-born content creators ("get found team"),
Look outside your marketing department (inside your company) and look outside the marketing industry (outside your company) to fill in talent gaps. P27
SET YOUR EMPLOYEES FREE
So much in the modern marketing world is consistent with what our parents taught us as kids. Our parents taught us to be ourselves, to be honest, to apologize for our mistakes, and to earn people's trust.
ACTION: Encourage employees to contribute to your company blog and to start tweeting about your company. Let them know you trust them to do the right thing-this trust will be rewarded. To help everyone take advantage of your new policy regarding social media, announce a Lunch-and-Learn about blogging best practices, using Twitter effective-ly, proper use of Facebook, and so forth. If you don't have the expertise, go online and search for webinars on the topic and show these at your Lunch-and-Learns.
Speak like a human in your releases, not like a press release robot.
Your marketplace's mother tongue is human-it speaks press release robot as a second language.
If you make a mistake, own up to it-don't try to hide it. P34
Due to the sweeping changes taking place in the Internet and social media, CEOs and small business owners alike tend to keep a tight rein on marketers, who, out of fear for their jobs, may become overly conservative, overthink decisions, or not take enough risks.
Like the Grateful Dead, marketers today need to experiment in their craft in order to make big breakthroughs. Instead of seeing failure as something to be avoided, CEOs and management teams need to free their marketers to experiment, quickly learn from failure, and experiment again. P39
RUN EXPERIMENTS IN YOUR MARKETING DEPARTMENT
Like music, marketing is a creative discipline. Instead of worrying about making mistakes, you should be doing at least five times more experiments than you are likely doing today. In terms of marketing, this could mean starting a blog, freeing your employees to Tweet or write posts for your blog, or leaving comments on others' blogs. You could start your own weekly podcast or TV show or create a new tool that gives people information they can use in their day-to-day jobs. The key to all of this is that you learn from your mistakes!
ACTION: Reframe your planning cycle in your company. It is okay to have an annual marketing budget, but plan your activities in monthly
"sprints" in which you execute your projects for 19 days a month, spend one day a month learning from the previous months' projects, and then selecting the next month's projects. When you pick your projects for the next month, make sure that at least 20 percent of them are purely experimental. P42
In every industry, there is a barely distinguishable herd of competitors that move in unison. Don't fall into the trap of moving in lockstep with that herd. Rather than try to outperform your competition in your existing industry, follow the Grateful Dead's recipe and create a new industry by reconstructing your market's boundaries.
The problem with innovating within industry boundaries is that you end up spending huge sums of money trying to move the needle a few percentage points in terms of market share.
When a boundary-changing newcomer comes along, companies and their mildly differentiated products lose tremendous market share and sometimes die as seen when Blockbuster reacted too late to competition from the Internet, broadband, and the "content-on-demand" services provided by cable companies and Netflix. P55
REDEFINE YOUR INDUSTRY BOUNDARIES
Every industry has opportunities for creating new ways of doing business that can separate your company from your competition and place you in your own unique category. Just as Y Combinator put some real thought into how VC and angel funding wasn't helping start-ups, and thus created a completely new category that is being followed by new groups like Techstars, you, too, must develop a similar approach to your industry.
ACTION: Redefining your industry boundaries is not an easy task.
Rather than try to tell you how to do it, we will pose some questions for you to ask yourself to get your ideas flowing.
In addition to thinking about your industry competitors, what are the
"altematives" to your product? Can you find ways to erase the traditional "boundaries" of your industry by incorporating or subsuming or competing with some of the altematives? P58
CULTIVATE ECCENTRICS
Have you noticed that people who are passionate about something are eager to talk it up, just like fans of the Grateful Dead want to talk up their favorite band? Your job is to create an experience that's unique, one that eccentrics will gravitate to, and one that they want to talk up.
ACTION: Build personality into your web site. Remove any content that looks similar to your competitors'. Delete what's boring. Make sure your web site, blog posts, newsletters, and e-mails are unlike all others in the marketplace. Being unique will make you stand out. Build up the information (videos, blog posts, e-books, and photos) that appeals to eccentrics in your marketplace. P66
There were interesting subgroups wandering along as part of the larger odyssey that was the Grateful Dead experience.
At many shows you saw Deaf Heads, people who could not hear the music but felt it through balloons that they held in front of them. As one would expect from a community as inclusive as Deadheads, many people who were not hearing-impaired learned how to sign "hello" to their fellow travelers. Spinners, another subgroup, enjoyed finding a bit of open space in the venue to spin, and spin... and spin ... in ecstasy to the music. It was a common sight that brought smiles to everyone's faces. The band noticed the Spinners and began installing speakers in the concourse area of the concert arenas so the spinners could enjoy quality sound, too, making Spinners true traveling companions on the odyssey instead of outliers. P73
LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR MARKETING MESSAGES
If you're to build a base of dedicated fans who will join you on an odyssey of success, you will need to lose control. Let your community define you, rather than trying to dictate what's said and how about your company. For example, you could work with bloggers, people who create and post videos onto YouTube, and other people active in social media. If you have a product or service that lends itself to providing free samples, find people to share it with and let them write about you. Or invite bloggers to your company to meet with staff or have an interview with your CEO or product designer. When you let others define and talk about you, it is more likely that a community will develop. And by all means when a community does develop (like the "spinners" at a Dead show), embrace what they have created and help it along (like the band did when they installed speakers for the spinners).
You can also get out into the marketplace and interact with the community as equals. Like Jake Burton and the Grateful Dead, both David and Brian also spend around 100 days each year with our community-we speak at events, participate in discussions, and hang out at Tweetups.
ACTION: Remove made-up, gobbledygook-laden mission statements, boierplate press releases, and other top-down messaging from your materials and web sites. Instead, point people to your community: the conferences, forums, chat rooms, and blogs of the people who talk you up. Then get out into your community and interact regularly. P76/76
Put Fans in the Front Row
If you're like us, you've been to concerts by many rock bands besides the Grateful Dead. Back in the day (prior to the Web), getting tickets for popular shows meant standing in line hours before the 10:00 A.M. on-sale time at the Ticketron outlet in your hometown. Or you could try your luck by calling the telephone number at 10:00, hoping you could get through and that tickets were available by the time you got off hold to speak to a representative. For popular bands, electronic ticketing meant that ticket scalpers would end up with the best seats, while fans often couldn't get tickets at all. This made it nearly impossible for the true fans to get up front at shows.
Unlike nearly every other band, the Grateful Dead controlled the ticket sales for their concerts. While other bands moved toward selling tickets through electronic systems of the day, like Ticketron and, later, Ticketmaster, the Grateful Dead established their own in-house ticketing agency in the early 1980s.
The unique ticketing system of the Grateful Dead led to word-of-mouth marketing like this: "Want some great seats to the Grateful Dead concert? You can buy tickets directly from the band. I know their phone number!" Fans would call a special telephone number to hear a recording about the upcoming tour and then mail in ticket requests, along with money orders, directly to the Grateful Dead ticketing office in San Rafael, California. The best seats were then mailed to those in the know, the fans who knew the drill and were motivated to go to the post office, get a money order, and follow the ticket request procedures. For most gigs, blocks of tickets were also sold at the venue box office and through the electronic ticketing systems. But the best seats always went to the band's biggest fans. P79/80
Always remember, your most passionate fans are also the people who tell your stories and spread your ideas. P81
CREATE EXCLUSIVE PROGRAMS FOR YOUR MOST LOYAL SUPPORTERS
Every organization should be thinking about how to cultivate its most loyal supporters and treat them as special. This approach need not be as formalized as the airline frequent flyer programs. Many times, simply alerting existing customers first with news and announcements is enough. Certainly, all companies should rethink the common practice used with telecommunications companies, newspapers, and magazines of offering cheaper rates new subscribers than to current ones.
ACTION: Identify your most loyal customers and add them to a database so that you can reach them. What can you offer them that would be valuable and not available to the general public?
Communicate to this loyal group first. Before your next product release, do a special event, teleconference, or webinar for your existing customers. Let them know first, before you alert the media and other constituents. P85

Extend your reach
Like the Grateful Dead, you should be an early adopter in your industry of ways to increase your reach in your marketplace. Since it's 2010 and not 1990, this means you should stop obsessing over your e-mail database and start enlarging your view of your "each" by focusing on your blog subscribers, Twitter followers, Facebook fans, and Linkedin Group members.
ACTION: Make a chart that shows the total  number of names on your email list plus your biog subscribers, latter followers, Facebook fans. and LinkedIn Group members. Update your chart monthly and make it part of your standard reporting and metics. Create a goal for yourself of growing your overall reach by 5 percent per month. P93
Most industries "grew up" with a distribution model that involved a layer or two of middlemen (i.e., brokers) between them and the customer. These layers were necessary because the brokers were "feet on the street" in the local markets and were nearer to the end-customer than the product producer.
The Internet has flipped this concept on its head. Being located physically near the end-user is much less valuable today than it was traditionally, as you can now reach and service end-customers through the Internet much more efficiently. For some industries, having middlemen between the product-maker and the end-user is still important if they are combining your product with other products and services in truly clever ways to add meaningful value. Having said that, in many industries, middlemen are just not adding the same amount of value today that they used to. THE GRATEFUL DEAD TEACHES US TO STRIP AWAY THE LAYERS BETWEEN US AND OUR CUSTOMERS
AND TO PULL THEM IN DIRECTLY. P99
The only way to truly determine the demand curve for your product is to try different price points with different customer sets over time to see where the break points are. As a marketer, it's important that you experiment with raising and lowering your prices to figure out the ideal configuration of pricing and packaging in order to maximize profit. When you go through brokers, it limits your ability to experiment with that pricing as it's difficult to get brokers to move their price points around. And, too, they'll often absorb the benefits of any price decrease experiments. P100
CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS
The Internet allows you to connect directly with your customers and can help you remove the margin-stripping layers inherent in a distribution channel. As a business owner or marketer, if you can remove these layers, you can increase your margins, increase control of your pricing and demand curve, and increase your authentic transparency with your end-users.
ACTION: If you make a product or service and sell it through brokers or distributors, ask yourself if that construct still makes sense in light of the fact that the Internet likely enables you to sell and service your offering much more efficiently (cheaply) than ever before. If you're starting a new business, do not assume that your industry's conventional wisdom about distribution strategy is right, as you might be able to jump over your industry's existing protagonists by skipping the middle-man. If you're a broker or middleman yourself, don't wear rose-colored glasses-you had better make sure that you add meaningful, unique value that is well beyond the capabilities of the manufacturer of the product or service that you're distributing. P102
YOU GOTTA GIVE TO GET
Great free stuff acts like a magnet as it both draws people to you and opens up the top of your marketing funnel in a dramatic way. Basically, the freemium model that the Grateful Dead pioneered, and companies like MySQL applied to the software industry, can work in any industry, even yours.
ACTION: Create a great e-book about your industry (not your product) that people will want to share with others. Create a brilliant video about how your industry will evolve over the next 10 years and post it on your blog and on YouTube. Do an industry survey to collect information about some interesting topic and create a remarkable report on it that your industry will love. Find a low-cost developer (try Rentacoder.com) and build an application for the iPhone or the Web that will give your market great pleasure (see www.websitegrader.com as an elaborate example).
Write a fantastic blog article once a week about your industry (not your product).
If this content you create is remarkable, it will draw visitors to your business in a far more dramatic way than the product or services page on your web site will ever do. P111
No band freely shared their music with fans the way the Grateful Dead did and as we've already pointed out, rather than working against them, setting their music free only fueled their success as Deadheads spread their music far and wide. Each tape was like an advertisement that attracted new people to one of their concerts. The more concerts the Grateful Dead performed, the more tapes were in the marketplace. The more copies were made of the tapes, the more advertisements were in the marketplace pulling in new customers. P114
DEVELOP A FREE OFFERING 
If you work in a software company, are part of an information business, or have an offering that can be delivered through the Web, you should be developing a free version and offering it on the Web with an upgrade path to a premium offering.
ACTION: Develop a free mobile application for your business.
For businesses that sell physical goods or services that cannot be delivered via the Web, you should consider developing a free mobile application for BlackBerry devices, iPhones, and other devices. For example, Stanley Black & Decker, one of the world's largest hand-tool and power-tool manufacturers, offers a free level application on the iPhone. Consumers use the level for such things as checking if a picture is hanging straight on a wall. The premium version, of course, is a more accurate professional-grade level from Stantey Black & Decker, and you have to pay for that at your local hardware store. P125
SET YOUR DESIGNERS FREE
ACTION: Give your designers leeway to play with your branding elements and invite customers and followers to share their ideas, You can maintain strict control over your brand in-house, but you quickly lose control once your brand is online. Let people use your theme song in videos and add your logo to blog posts, Instead of fighting back, post the more creative videos and other content to your web site. Or why not crowdsource the next design that you need by announcing a contest for young designers to take a crack at, say, your tradeshow booth graphics. No matter what you do with outside people, you should certainly let your in-house and chief outside designers come up with new ideas that loosen up your brand. while still maintaining your corporate image. P133
In a previous chapter, we talked about cutting out the mid-dleman. Recall that we discussed how the Grateful Dead sold tickets directly to fans. Now in this chapter, we're suggesting that you partner with entrepreneurs in the way that the Grateful Dead did with merchandise sellers. At first glance, these strategies may seem contradictory. They're not. Instead, they are two different strategies. While ticket brokers acted as a monopoly (until the Dead broke it) and made money from tickets to the bands shows that would have sold anyway, the merchandise sellers, who were not acting as a monopoly, were adding to the availability of goods. Each style of T-shirt, coffee cup, sweatshirt, and pin was a bit different. Just as important, the ticket brokers were huge corporations, not Grateful Dead fans. The merchandise sellers were entrepreneurial fans. P138
When the Grateful Dead began licensing sellers of logo merchandise, many observers thought the program foolish because the band was thought to be reducing its overall revenue. But band members decided it was better to get more logos out there and to keep the community happy than to make a few more dollars. They figured, rightly of course, that the money would come as the band became even more popular. For the Grateful Dead, the strategy was wildly successful. P140
PARTNER WITH THOSE WHO ARE EAGER TO SELL YOUR STUFF
Do you have people selling versions of your products and services that seem in competition to your direct sales efforts? Maybe the right thing to do is to partner with those entrepreneurs rather than sending them a legal notice. What about companies that sell services related to yours?
Is there an opportunity there?
ACTION: Get with your legal staff and make it clear that you want to review any cease-and-desist action before it is implemented. In many organizations, the initial reaction-to say "no" - is implemented before anyone has a chance to review the decision. Better yet, proactively find and approach companies that seem to be competitors and work out a way to help one another. If you're a realtor, why not forge a partnership with a home improvement company. Manufacturers or retailers of baby and children products should work out a deal to sell merchandise on so-called "Mommy-blogger" sites. P141
GIVE BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITY
Of course most of us don't have the ability to perform benefit concerts in front of 20,000 people, nor are we likely to work within a huge company that can invest in a Ronald McDonald's House-sized effort. Don't let that stop you from giving back! Follow the lead of the Grateful Dead and give back in your area of expertise. For example, we frequently speak as guest lecturers at colleges and universities in the Boston area. We feel that providing our ideas to students at Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Simmons, Babson, Emerson, and other institutions is a worthwhile way for us to personally give back to our community. It not only benefits the students but positively benefits us too.
In addition, we're donating 25 percent of our royalties from this book to the Grateful Dead Archive at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to support further study of the Grateful Dead in business, society, and music.
ACTION: Pick a way to give back to your community in some form that is consistent with your brand and start doing it now. P148


### Understanding Fandom
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2013
- **Author**: Mark Duffett

Sports fandom remains the most accepted model for fandom in our society. Although a minority of researchers have studied both topics, in many ways sports fandom and media fandom are very different objects of study? Sports fandom is ultimately tribal and based on a controlled, competitive mentality.
It raises passionate instincts that are significantly different in both meaning and intensity to those associated with enjoying television, music or cinema. P3
Fandom is a sociocultural phenomenon largely associated with modern capitalist societies, electronic media, mass culture and public performance. In most research there is a tendency to talk about the phenomenon as if it has always existed, fully formed, in society. Some scholars have called for more research that historicizes fandom. As that issue is increasingly being addressed, writers have begun to unearth a complex history which demonstrates Henry Jenkins' claim that 'Nobody functions entirely within fan culture, nor does fan culture maintain any claims to self-sufficiency. There is nothing timeless and unchanging about this culture; fandom originates as a response to specific historical conditions' (1992, 3). Those conditions stem from shifts in the media and their tendency to reconfigure everyday experience. P5
In the middle of the 1960s the astounding popularity of the Beatles sparked a new wave of debate that tended to characterize their phenomenon as fan hysteria. Two other intriguing episodes in the history of Beatles fandom happened in the summer of 1966- when Americans learned that John Lennon had compared his group's popularity to that of Jesus - and October 1969 - when a false rumour took root that claimed Paul McCartney was dead!" Towards the end of the 1960s - partly in the wake of the band's influence - many young people 'dropped out' of society to form the counter-culture: a movement that mixed chemically-induced intoxication and enthusiasm for progressive rock with a commitment to civil rights and anti-war protest." The 500,000 young music enthusiasts who attended the Woodstock festival in 1969 shared a generational love of rock songs and alternative social values.
Within a few short years, however, arena rock bands were using spectacles of mass fandom to serve their own interests (see Waksman 2007). P10
Educated by non-linear media such as video games, film goers began to expect a different entertainment experience. By 1999 a range of media began to provide it. Transmedia storytelling is the process of telling different parts of the same story through different electronic media. The success of The Blair Witch Project Website and horror film in 1999 encouraged Hollywood to further invest in the process (103). Directors Andy and Lana Wachowski released The Matrix that year as the first episode in a three-part franchise that told its story across many different media outlets. Their trilogy ambiguously mixed elements of sci-fi, anime, futurology, religious analogy, social history and morality tale. It also made unprecedented - and for some unwelcome - demands on consumers (96). As video games became more like movies, Hollywood therefore began to differentiate itself again by encouraging fans to engage with extended versions of the text before visiting the cinema (106). In parallel, television shifted to emphasize the excitement of live broadcasting. P12
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, cultural scholars, myself included, depicted media fandom as an important test site for ideas about active consumption and grassroots creativity. We were drawn toward the idea of "fan culture" as operating in the shadows of, in response to, as well as an altemative to commercial culture. Fan culture was defined through the appropriation and transformation of materials borrowed from mass culture; it was the application of folk cultural practices to mass cultural content. P16
Objectivity is the idea that universally valid knowledge can be built from impartial investigation. No history can be completely objective; it is necessarily a limited and partial explanation. Francesca Coppa's (2007) otherwise excellent history of media fandom in relation to fan art, for example, tends to focus on US television shows. Every act of storytelling means not only making choices about what to keep in and leave out but also how to slant the evidence. Since no narrative can include every perspective at the same time, there is no such thing as a perfect overview. P17
Everyone knows what a 'fan' is. It's somebody who is obsessed with a particular star, celebrity, film, TV programme, band; somebody who can produce reams of information on the object of their fandom, can quote their favoured lines or lyrics, chapter and verse. Fans are highly articulate. Fans interpret media texts in a variety of interesting and perhaps unexpected ways. And fans participate in communal activities - they are not 'socially atomised' or isolated viewers/readers... So, how have 'fandom' and the media 'cult' been defined academically? To date, defining 'fandom' has been no easy task, despite (or perhaps because of) the 'everydayness' of the term. P18
The definition of fandom has some easy answers at first sight. Discussions have focused not just on the degree of audience involvement, but also on its quality (Cavicchi 1998, 39). A fan is a person with a relatively deep, positive emotional conviction about someone or something famous, usually expressed through a recognition of style or creativity. He/she is also a person driven to explore and participate in fannish practices. Fans find their identities wrapped up with the pleasures connected to popular culture. They inhabit social roles marked out as fandom. P18
Fandom can indeed involve different experiences, concern different practices and mean different things in various contexts. Even if we share identity as fans of the same media object, my fandom may be experienced as something very different from yours. If fandom is not a singular entity, though, why do fans of the same object have the same interests? Also, why do fans of different objects behave in such similar ways? An ideal theory would be calibrated to shared experiences, sufficiently simple and internally consistent. P19
The word 'consumption' indicates participation in a commercial process, but since 'to consume means to digest and to exhaust it also implies a kind of using up. We can therefore separate two intricate meanings for the same word: to be part of 'economic' consumption means to participate in a financial transaction as a buyer, while to 'culturally' consume is to meaningfully examine a particular media product. P20
In some senses, media fans resemble ideal brand consumers: they snap up the latest thing, buy extra merchandise, participate in promotions, join official fan clubs and build collections (Cavicchi 1998, 62). They form a particularly stable market. If fans are the target consumers for new products and franchises, they are also niche markets that represent the residue of a culture first facilitated by mass marketing (Hills 2002a, 45). The 80-20 rule says that 20 percent of the audience (i.e. fans) create 80 percent of the profits (Jenkins 2008, 72). Indeed, their acceptance is seen to be an organic measure of the triumph of many media products and is integral to promotion:
"Fan consumers are no longer viewed as eccentric irritants, but rather as loyal consumers to be created, where possible, or otherwise to be courted through scheduling practices' (Hills 2002a, 36). Fandom does not escape or resist commodity culture. Instead consumption facilitates fans' contact with media products. P21
However, to see fandom as primarily about consumption is to forget, first, that fans often like things for free, and, second, that they are always more than consumers. They are more than buyers and their transactions are pursued with a cultural interest that goes beyond merely practicing the process of buying. An interesting example of this is provided by Tom McCourt and Patrick Burkart (2007) who show how music fans need online discussion spaces that are greater than anything that customer relationship management systems can provide. Fans are more than consumers because they have especially strong emotional attachments to their objects and they use them to create relationships with both their heroes and with each other (Ferris & Harris 2011, 13). They can be distinguished by their off-by-heart knowledge of their text and their expertise both about it and any associated material (see Brooker 2002, 31; Gray 2010). They are always already consumers- as we all are - but they necessarily have more roles than that (Hills 2002a, 27). Fans are networkers, collectors, tourists, archivists, curators, producers and more. P21
Agency is the ability of individual people to act and behave in ways that make a difference to wider society. Booth's idea that fans operate a parallel economy of sharing when they can is useful because it shows a moment of agency when fans are motivated to help others to experience their favourite texts, not necessarily for anyone's financial gain. What we can therefore say, perhaps, is that fans will often talk about their connections to mediated phenomena, but - at least in speech if not in practice - they are rarely enthusiastic advocates of economic consumption perse. They may have discovered their interests through it. They may sometimes accept it as a necessary means of acquiring the experiences, making the connections or providing the benefits of media resource ownership that they desire. Yet they do not enact the process for its own sake or enter into it with an innate passion for it alone. Rather, the non-commercial nature of fan culture is, for many fans, one of its key characteristics: they are engaged in a labour of love (Jenkins 2008, 180) and if they produce or promote media culture, it is often on a not-for-profit basis.
For this reason, several researchers have understood fan exchange as a gift economy.' P23
What we can say is that fandom is often pursued as a hobby, but it has elements of passionate identification that take it beyond a mere pastime and make it part of the identity of the individual. P24
Grossberg's one carefully distinguishes fandom from ideological mass persuasion like politics or organized religion. Nobody likes to believe that they are ideologically manipulated. Fans say that they 'love' their heroes. While they may have experiences and feelings that are different from non-fans, they are not fundamentalists or zealots. They seem enjoyably fascinated with their own passions. Yet, upon closer inspection the idea of fandom as a particular type of identification or connection has more issues than one may think. Cornel Sandvoss (2005a, 6) has argued that definitions of fandom centred around emotional intensity are poor because fans do not always self-classify based on their emotional intensity. Because media genres like horror conventionally celebrate knowledge over emotion, some dedicated fans may fail to self-identify as they do not display the required intensity of commitment (Hills 2002a, xv). Some forms of genre-based and collecting-orientated forms of fandom are associated with an early peak of emotion that tends to change and give way to different, more intellectual and
"cooler' forms of passion,? Also emotional intensity cannot be scientifically measured. Just as there are floating audience members who lack dedication but nevertheless self-identify as fans, so there are emotionally engaged consumers who can shun the label. Rather than isolating an objective category. perhaps we need to see identifying as one of the central personal and cultural processes of fandom. At some initial point the fan has to deeply connect with, and love - or at least be fascinated by - the object of their interest. P25
First, despite the myth of 100 percent dedication, most fans are fascinated with a variety of different artists or media products. Daniel Cavicchi noted that most of the fans who self-identified as Bruce Springsteen followers listen to Springsteen's music 30-50 percent of the time, between two and four hours a day (1998, 113-14). More significantly, genre fans may watch or hear a particular text just once and still claim to be dedicated. Maybe we should therefore examine other practices. Fans are theorists and expert critics. P26
Community and performance
This ability to transform personal reaction into social interaction, spectatorial culture into participatory culture, is one of the central characteristics of fandom. One becomes a 'fan' not by being a regular viewer of a particular program but by translating that viewing into some kind of cultural activity, by sharing feelings and thoughts about program content with friends, by joining a 'community' of other fans who share common interests. P27
What all the definitions of fandom discussed so far have missed out is its highly personal, experiential, inner dimension. To become a fan is to find yourself with an emotional conviction about a specific object. As a fan himself, Daniel Cavicchi has emphasized this dimension in his own definitions. He explains, 'Fandom is not a bounded entity to be discovered and commented on, or a problem to be questioned and answered; it is a complex, private yet shared, ongoing experience' (1998, 18). This is important to Cavicchi, because many - perhaps most - popular academic theories have seen the self as a set of social relationships and denied the validity of the autonomous individual.
To put it another way, fans' heartfelt convictions are missing in action from cultural theory, relegated as unimportant compared to processes of economic or sociological interaction. For Cavicchi, 'On the whole, fandom is not some particular thing one has or does. Fandom is a process of being; it is the way one is'. P30
Fans are, for example, often stereotyped as 'a group insistent on making meaning from materials others have characterized as trivial and worthless‚Äô. P38
Perhaps the most important charge on the list of stereotypes unearthed by Jenkins was (g) that fans could not tell their fantasies from reality. A pair of terms from the philosophy of knowledge are worth introducing here: ontology and epistemology. Ontologists examine systems of knowledge to see how they conceptualize what there is to know about the world. Epistemology is the study of how people form acceptable knowledge. In relation to fandom, the stereotype of fans as fantasists suggests that they have got it wrong ontologically (in believing that they can fully 'know' a celebrity, if, for example, they find out what he/she ate for breakfast). It suggests that they have also made an epistemological mistake in gathering their knowledge about stars, because they cling to a grave falsehood (the celebrity image) and percerve commercially mediated encounters as reliable sources. The critique of fandom therefore suggests that fans cannot tell fantasy from reality and are on the road to trouble. P41
One response to this is to say that we are all fans now as media audience members and that the distinction no longer matters. An associated perception is that fans were the pioneers who spearheaded the current age of audience participation. Yet if cult film and TV series are increasingly organized as elaborate franchises, if media products are orchestrated to provide a greater depth of cultural stimulation, if box sets and streaming Websites allow any of us to watch our favourite episodes again - and if viewers are encouraged to leave comments online (see Gorton 2009, 40-1) - does that not automatically make everyone a fan? The distance between media consumption practices may be narrowing, but contemporary culture still marks out an emotional and rhetorical divide between the identities of the fan and the ordinary audience member. Owning a box set does not make one a fan. Neither does watching every episode. There has to be a peaking of fascination inside the individual that is expressed in some way. Furthermore, while fans may have become the talkative poster-children of an era of new media, beyond academia they are still framed as inadequate by significant. sections of society, especially when they pursue particular kinds of interest and objects of attention. P45
Marginalized fandoms
The incident of encountering a male Philadephia Eagles fan] reminded me that a sort-of social hierarchy still existed when it came to 'fandoms', and within the hierarchy sports would always be at the top of the pile while media fandom would be regarded as slightly suspect by the mainstream. There's nothing odd at all about flying your team flag in front of your house, but can you imagine your neighbours reaction if you hoisted up the iconic Doctor Who logo? P45
Another point here is that desire for emotional intimacy has traditionally been socially coded as feminine, so spaces of community in popular culture may conceivably liberate fans who might otherwise have trouble in letting themselves go. P46
Fans can be loving critics, but they have to pur their fannish identity aside if they wish to play the role of the ordinary critic.
Meanwhile, anti-tans, in Gray's sense, are neither fans nor ordinary critics.
Instead they are the inverse of loving critics; as hating critics they are bound up with the text and vehemently complain about it. They have dropped the ordinary critic's embargo against passion because they passionately dislike or even detest the object of their attention. Consequently, rather like the idea of 'anti-matter' in physics, although Gray's label is illuminative - insofar that it points to something formerly invisible in a sociocultural sense - it does not quite grasp. Anti-fans are not inverse fans, but are inverse loving critics. P48
Anti-fans can emerge on a more parochial level if they believe that a new media franchise will usurp the fan base of their favourite show. This can set up mutual antagonisms between different fan bases, because fans of populist phenomena can believe that if their community loses size then it might be in danger of being forgotten. Doctor Who, for example, had run on British television from 1963 onwards while Star Trek came later in 1968. In Who fan lore, if you like Doctor Who you are likely to be an anti-fan of Star Trek (Hills 2010b, 55). Similarly, in popular music, press stories often set artists up against each other in supposed battles. Examples here include Elvis Presley against Pat Boone in the 1950s, the Stones against the Beatles in the 1960s, Guns N¬∞ Roses against Bon Jovi in the 1980s, and Blur against Oasis in the 1990s. While such oppositional pairings create news copy by highlighting important distinctions in the masculinity or cultural orientation of each pair of contenders, what such music battle stories - or scif contests, for that matter-forget is that ordinary fans frequentiy like both contenders and may well be dedicated fans of both of them. P49
if ordinary people use the signs and meanings of cultural products in ways unintended by media producers, then those people participate in popular culture. On the other hand, if the audience members accept the signs and meanings offered by the industry, then they participate only in mass culture. P63
fans and producers both, to a different extent, have power over the social construction of meaning and their interests can sometimes conflict with no easy victory in sight. However, De Certeau hypothesized isolated readers who were separated from the practice of writing; Jenkins (1992, 45) realized that fans operated communally and could make their own fanzines, novels, art or music. Unlike de Certeau, he believed he should not just theorize readers' activities but also document them. P67
At one extreme, some cultural producers take a charitable approach to fan creativity. Will Wright, who created The Sims game in 2000, did not assert copyright over an unofficial Website called 'The Mall of the Sims'. Instead he just let it happen and even courted the fans, by saying, 'We are competing with other properties for these creative individuals'. This is significant as The Sims became one of the most successful games franchises ever (171). Other producers have aimed to bring fan creativity under their wing, as Lucastim did with Star Wars (Jenkins 1992, 30-1). After the media controversy over Warner's quashing of Harry Potter fan creativity, the corporation decided to collaborate with and deputize fans (Jenkins 2008, 196). Aided by shifts in digital technology, media producers are therefore increasingly recognizing that fan cultures represent an alternative rather than oppositional community (Mihelich & Papineau 2005, 184). P74
'Worshipping a celebrity does not make you dysfunctional, but it does put you at risk of being so. There is this progression of behaviours, and if you start, we don't know what's going to stop you! Writers who say fandom is dangerous often argue that particular individuals in fan cultures are vulnerable since each fan can develop intense personal feelings of obsession to a point where he/she experiences something strong and irrational. Obsessed fans supposedly retreat into social isolation, have 'narcissistic linking fantasies" and become overly fixated on their star.
If the fan's attempts to communicate with the celebrity go unrequited - or if the celebrity challenges the image that has been constructed of them - the obsessed follower's immense emotional investment can supposedly cause them to enter a resentful rage and to release their anger by attacking or murdering their hero. Is this really about warding off the beast within, or is it about celebrity psychiatrists courting the media by pathologizing fandom? P87
Fan practices are frequently more about comfort, relaxation and pleasure than they are about frustration with unavailable intimacy. Of course, admirers may wish to communicate their feelings or to meet their star - just for the thrill - but it is important to realize that they already feel boosted by their engagement. As Cavicchi reported:
Media critics consider fans abnormal or dangerous; however, I have found that my fandom for various musical performers has, instead, gotten me through many tough times over the years and has been the source of many friendships, including my relationship with my wife. (1998, 8)
According to sociologists Kerry Ferris and Scott Harris, 'Fans differ from ordinary consumers of fame because they form especially strong emotional attachments to the objects of their interest, and they can use those attachments as the stepping-stone both to relationships with other fans and to relationships with the famous themselves‚Äô. P98/99
Fandom begins when we identify something of great interest to us. it is driven by personal connection and fascination and it can become a kind of for intimacy with a famous person. It is also a process where personal passion and energy are productively focused. This does not mean that fandom is inherently about obsession, however. Instead, the term exploits fascination as a way to pathologize fandom as always vulnerable to imbalance and excess, always potentially tipping over into something inappropriate and dangerous.
Commentators who see fandom as excessive implicitly contrast it to more restricted and civilized" forms of behaviour. They confuse a social role with a personal predisposition; perhaps we can say that individuals can be obsessive, but roles are just roles and do not have the agency to obsess. To attribute that agency to roles is, in this case, to say that fandom marks out our pervasive social anxiety about losing our individuality and independence. In some ways, obsession is therefore really another way to discuss possession. Taking this a step further, since fan dedication sometimes boils down to trumping others' knowledge, media collections, or tales of intimacy with a highly-valued star, we can say that the obsession/possession discourse may well reflect the external assumption that extreme fandom is a trap in which individuals fall when they attempt to elevate their low self-esteem by competing against others. P102/103 
Mark Chapman is a real person whose ugly andspointless crime meant that he has been denied parole for over a decade. The monstrous deranged fan' role is something he has never fully inhabited, however, because, upon inspection symbolic resonance in marking a shift from the anti-materialist 1960s to the offered evidence of a social fascination with stalking that indirectly critiqued the vacuity of contemporary celebrity culture. In an era where seemingly undeserving glitterati from Paris Hilton so Victoria Beckham found fame just for being themselves, and where Celebrity Big Brother (2001-) and its variants made the rejection of celebrities into a spectator sport, stalking was symbolically refurbished as a fulfilment of collective fantasy. Capitalizing on the sixth occasion that Chapman was denied parole for his crime, echoing Lady Gaga's album, the Salon journalist Mary Elizabeth Williams (2010) called Chapman a 'fame monster. P112/113
Fandom is, however, often experienced as an emotional activity. Emotions are not just physical disturbances of the body: they follow from beliefs and thoughts. In theory, psychoanalysis may help to create a more emotionally engaged depiction of individual fans. Therefore to talk about fandom we may need to keep both individual psychology and its cultural context in motion. P114
it is important to understand that fans recognize their own fandom as an aspect of their personal identities, and that they can engage with stars or auteurs in ways that feel intensely personal.
Fan researchers have tended to focus on agency and activity, and neglected structure and object (93). Is there something inside each fan, then, that organizes his or her connection to a hero? P115
One avenue opened by the idea is to see fandom as a kind of safe haven for the knocks that life can throw at each of us. Some fans recognize that fractions of the fan base find vicarious comfort and escape in following a star. As Sandvoss explains:
Fandom provides one of most stable eggs in the [self-esteem] basket
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢.in this sense fandom is not an articulation of inner needs and drives, but is itself constitutive of the self. Being a fan in this sense reflects and constructs the self. P119
Media fans are just people. Like anyone else, they can be rational, biased, stubborn, critical, tired, liberal or open-minded. One of the central differences between fans and other people, however, is that they have experienced a meaningfully different feeling to others and cannot always rationally explain why. Researchers have described this as a kind of self-absent quality. P123/124
One woman, for instance, discussed how she discovered several artists such as Joni Mitchell at the same time as her sister, and she felt a sense of 'female camaraderie' about them (1998, 180). This kind of camaraderie inspires people to explore their siblings' record collections as a form of peer identification, whether at the time or later in nostalgic reverie. P127
The acquisition of taste is thus a subtle game of one-upmanship that each of us (perhaps unknowingly) plays with our closest neighbours in order to climb, or at least keep our place in, the social system. Taste is therefore a means we use to competitively classify ourselves as social beings. P130

There are three key mental shortcuts that help people decide between brands.
We call them Fame, Feeling and Fluency. To our fast-thinking, System 1 minds:
- If a brand comes readily to mind, it's a good choice (Fame).
- If a brand feels good, it's a good choice (Feeling).
- If a brand is recognisable, it's a good choice (Fluency). P17. 
There is no simple recipe for creating fame, nor can it be done in a purely calculating and clinical way; it needs the energy, imagination, risk taking and shameless braggadocio that street entertainers and charlatans have relied on in all ages. P30
These are only a few points from a much longer and more complex story, but they may be enough to suggest some of the conditions that make fame possible.
TIl ouline these briefly now, but will return to them as we go on to develop them as a tentative template for how we could think about the creation of fame, whether for brands, celebrities, or anything else.
1. Some intrinsic qualities are needed which will be compelling or attractive enough for the celebrity to appeal to the public and, first of all, gain admittance to a platform from which the public can be appealed to.
1. But what is also needed is the ability to access audiences repeatedly and on a massive scale. It is very rare for this to happen automatically as a result of intrinsic talen some mechanism for achieving mass exposure must also be employed. In the case of the Beckhams, this abilicy to command mass exposure was initially contrived by their agents (Fuller and Spencer), access to events or contexts that already had mass audiences (che Brits, Virgin Records, Manchester United), and soon by themselves becoming a news story which media could not resist covering.
1. The oclebrity must be associared with enough unique and memorable images or other distinctive assets' to be immediarely recognisable and distinctive. Their distinctive assets, besides their faces, included nicknames and jokes (Posh and Becks, Beckingham Palace), hairstyles and outfits.
1. When the combination of intrinsic qualities, distinctive assets and mass exposure reach a certain critical point, social diffusion kicks in and multiplies the effects: this is driven both by the public and the media in a symbiotic relationship. Social diffusion is often powerfully enhanced by controversy or ambiguity, as press and public alike respond to events by trying to make sense of them or arguing abour them.
1. 
The management of fame therefore involves three territories beside the most obvious one of ensuring that the intrinsic appeal of the brand/ celebrity/ product is maintained. There must be a conscious strategy for reaching mass audiences (repeatedly); careful nurturing of distinctive assets; and the use of the many techniques which exist for enabling and encouraging social diffusion.
None of chis is very new. The formula describes Barnum's success with Jenny Lind (or indeed the Feejee Mermaid). Jenny Lind was, as the Times put ic, merely a talented vocalist. Her talent as a performer had already made her famous enough in Europe to attract Barnum's attention. But it was Barnum who created the platform for her to perform, and attracted the mass audiences who would become aware of her (by no means limited only to those wealthy enough to actually hear her perform), by providing news stories which the media of the day were keen ra present to their mass audiences. P84/85
What Holt calls cultural branding' has enough truth in it to sound plansible, things that want to stay famous need to be responsive to changing times, attitudes, and fashions, and occasionally they do something that so captures a popular mood or moment in time that it has a greater than usual impact. P100
My second difficulty with accepting cultural branding as a practical approach is thar i sems to me to substitute a different kind of essentialism for the brand bureaucracy Holt and Cameron so reject. Its much easier to post-rationalise the abstract meanings behind cultural phenomena than to start from abstract meanings and create something tangible. Of course, if you can make this approach work for you, that's great. But as Holt himself admits at the ourset, the process of'cultural branding has in reality always been a tacit and emergent one:

I've yet to find a cultural brand strategy articulated in formal documents like marketing plans, brand bibles, and creative briefs... cultural brand strategies have lurked primarily in the gut feel of ad agency creatives and other commercial artists. P101
Traditional advertising that only entertains doesn‚Äôt work. P109
The principal effect of advertising for mature brands in mature categories is to defend brand share and price against the competition. P110
Brands with a higher share of voice than share of market tend to grow, while those spending less than their share of market tend to decline. P112
l's also true that our perception of what constitutes a great performance is massively influenced by fame itself. Because fame is a 'complex, adaptive, semi-chaotic system it grows and evolves through time, and one of the important feedback loops within it is the fact that we rate things more highly as they increase in fame and familiarity. Because we prefer what is familiar, because we choose what comes more easily to mind, and because we are more attracted to what we see valued by others, things tend to become more attractive to us as they become better known and more popular. In the words of Jeremy Bullmore that I quoted earlier,

...for most human beings, fame not only holds a powerful fascination but bestows an incalculable value on anything that enjoys it. We value the famous far more highly than the little known. P123
where it might lead us. What lessons could brands learn (or perhaps remind themselves of) from rudies of fame in the worlds of entertainment, fashion, and celebricy, such as Hit Makers or The Tipping Point? Because, despite the inescapable element of chance, if we understand which factors are generally necessary conditions for fame, we may least increase the odds in our favour.
Both Thompson's and Gladwell's inquiries separate the factors which enable fame into two groups. The first group includes all the intrinsic qualities of the performance itself which make it attractive and distinctive; the second group, the ways in which the performance becomes exposed to and is diffused among large populations. Both of these matter: both are usually necessary conditions for success. There are intrinsic qualities in a performance that significantly increase the chances of it becoming famous; but it will not become famous automatically as a result of these intrinsic qualities (except as a highly rare event).
In making this distinction, both authors draw explicit parallels with epidemiology.
The spread of a disease can also be analysed as a function of two different kinds of factors. The first group of factors are to do with the intrinsic nature of the infecting organism - the way it is transmitted, how easily it is transmitted, how long it remains infectious in the carrier, etc. The second group of factors are contextual - these include environmental factors (e.g. the prevalence of anopheles mosquitoes for malaria, an infected source of water for cholera), and many social patterns of human behaviour which may either enable or inhibit the transmission of the disease, such as hygiene, travel, sexual activity, and so on.
Gladwell sums up this analogy at the outset of his book:
..the idea is very simple. It is that the best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb and flow of crime waves...the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth, or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviours spread just like viruses do. (p. 7, emphasis added). P125
These three approaches have in recent years been labelled as paid for, earned and owned media. Perhaps the most reliable approach is to make use of all three, as the safest route to fame has always been to do as much as possible.
One of the core strategic principles of the British Armed Forces is called The Principle of Redundancy. The idea is that if you are fighting a war there is no point in trying to optimise efficiency - the only thing that matters is winning.
The more tanks, the more aircraft, the more drones, the more ammunition, the more field hospitals you have, the better your chances. Rather than ask 'how cheaply can we do this?, the question is 'how much can we possibly get and how much can we possibly deploy?. This idea runs completely counter to modern business's obsession with efficiency, yet it tends to characterise the major land-grabs of fame. A hundred years ago, Coca-Cola won territory in the soft drinks market it has held ever since by endlessly multiplying its mental and physical availability; in the present century, Amazon has won what currently looks like an unassailable position in online retailing by investing more than it makes every year into growing the business. Barnum did not launch Jenny Lind's tour by booking three concerts to 'see how it went' - he almost bankrupred himself in committing to 150, and as a result they all sold out. Excess and apparent wastage are not just important because they accelerate the gain of a dominant position. P129
If there is a choice to be made between efficiency and thinking big, you cannot afford to be efficient if you want to be famous.
So I believe mass communication events should be considered necessary in any strategy for creating fame. But they are not sufficient. We also need to consider what factors make content infectious. What are the qualities that make something enjoyable or interesting enough for people to spend time with it, remember it, value it, and share it with others? And what kind of processes and cultures are more likely to produce such content? P130
I think the concept of distinctive assets can be applied to any kind of fame.
Celebrities each have a ready-made distinctive asset in their own face, though many add importantly to this with other aspects of personal styling - Bill Haley's kiss curl, Elviss quiff, Freddy Mercury's moustache, even Donald Trump's lurid comb over. Geri Halliwell's Union Jack dress, Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and cane, James Dean's overcoat all have aspects of distinctive assets, and so of course do personal catchphrases and individual accents: if I mention a red fez and the words 'Just Like That!' spoken in a northern accent, most British readers will know who I mean. But because examples are so universally easy to find, in this chapter I shall focus on distinctive assets used by brands, and especially in advertising. P144
widespread and lasting fame, whether for entertainers, celebrities, or commercial brands, almost invariably depends on meeting four conditions.
- First, whatever is offered must be sufficiently interesting or appealing to people;
- Secondly, it must find ways to reach mass audiences;
- Thirdly it must be distinctive, unique and memorable and it helps a lot if it's legally ownable too);
- Fourthly, the public and the media themselves must engage with it actively (and they can be encouraged though not compelled to do so).
These propositions may sound obvious, even banal. But let's consider also what they leave out as relatively unimportant. Fame does not, for instance, automatically reward the best product or performer - unless they can fulfil these other conditions, they won't be famous. P163
So why, in that case, does the advertising industry today so often seem to ignore these simple principles - even to consciously avoid them? With a dwindling number of honourable exceptions, it seems to me that professional practice in the twenty-first century is dominated by the following characteristics:
‚Ä¢ An obsession with targeting and efficiency, and too much wishful thinking about the power of virality, both routinely eclipse any ambition to achieve mass coverage.
Far too much of what is produced by ad agencies not only lacks any popular appeal, but seems proud of the fact that it has avoided it. Popular' is almost a term of abuse.
- The use of distinctive assets, as was shown earlier, has declined almost to the point of extinction - just at the moment when we seem to have a better scientific basis for understanding why they matter so much.
- And in the absence of these first three conditions, it is not surprising if most brands form a very small part of today's public conversations. P164
Creativity is, after all, about breaking something down and putting something new in its place. (emphasis added)

Paul Arden, the late creative director and author of a best-selling little book called It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be, wrote,
All creative people need something to rebel against.

Yet every example I have given earlier in this book - such as Barclaycard, 'Hilltop, or the Honey Monster - suggests that all this is, at best, one small strand in the process of creating something that appeals to the public or has any lasting value. Familiarity is as important as originality; craft is much more important than destruction; playfulness, collaboration, and patience (however painful) are normally much more productive than anger and machismo. It's not just about blowing shit up. P180


### Society of The Spectacle
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 1967
- **Author**: Guy Debord

THE IMAGES detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream in which the unity of that life can no longer be recovered. Fragmented views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a separate pseudo-world that can only be looked at. The specialization of images of the world evolves into a world of autonomised images where even the deceivers are deceived. The spectacle is a concrete inversion of life, an autonomous movement of the nonliving. P7
THE SPECTACLE is not a collection of images; it‚Äôs is a social relation between people that is mediated by images. P7
 THE SOCIETY based on modern industry is not accidentally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist. In the spectacle - the visual reflection of the ruling economic order - goals are nothing, development is everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself. P10
THE SPECTACLE is able to subject human being to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them. It is nothing other than the economy developing for itself. It is at once a faithful reflection of the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers. P10
THE FIRST stage of the economy's domination of social life brought about an evident degradation of being into having - human fulfilment was no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed. The present stage, in which social life has become completely dominated by the accumulated productions of the economy, is bringing about a general shift from having to appearing - all "having" must now derive its immediate prestige and its ultimate purpose from appear-ances. At the same time all individual reality has become so-cial, in the sense that it is shaped by social forces and is directly dependent on them. Individual reality is allowed to appear only if it is not actually real. P10/11

WHEN THE real world is transformed into mere images, mere images become real beings - dynamic figments that provide the direct motivations for a hypnotic behaviour.
Since the spectacle's job is to use various specialised mediations in order to show us a world that can no longer be directly grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special pre-eminence once occupied by touch: the most abstract and easily deceived sense is the most readily adaptable to the generalised abstraction of present-day society. But the spectacle is not merely a matter of images, nor even of images plus sounds. It is whatever escapes people's activity, whatever eludes their practical reconsideration and correction. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever representation becomes independent, the spectacle regenerates itself. P11

PHILOSOPHY - the power of separate thought and the thought of separate power - was never by itself able to supersede theology. The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion. Spectacular technology has not dispersed the religious mists into which human beings had projected their own alienated powers, it has merely brought those mists down to earth, to the point that even the most mundane aspects of life have become impenetrable and un-breathable. The illusory paradise that represented a total denial of earthly life is no longer projected into the heavens, it is embedded in earthly life itself. The spectacle is the technological version of the exiling of human powers into a "world beyond"; the culmination of humanity's internal separation. P12

DUE TO the very success of this separate production of sepa-ration, the fundamental experience that in earlier societies was associated with people's primary work is in the process of being replaced (in sectors near the cutting edge of the system's evolution) by an identification of life with nonworking time, with inactivity. But such inactivity is in no way liberated from productive activity. It remains dependent on it, in an uneasy and admiring submission to the requirements and consequences of the production system. It is itself one of the consequences of that system. There can be no freedom apart from activity, and within the spectacle activity is nullified - all real activity having been forcibly channelled into the global construction of the spectacle. Thus, what is referred to as a "liberation from work," namely the modern increase in leisure time, is neither a liberation of work itself nor a liberation from the world shaped by this kind of work. None of the activity stolen by work can be regained by submitting to what that work has produced. P15
THE ALIENATION of the spectator, which reinforces the contemplated objects that result from his own unconscious activity, works like this: The more he contemplates, the less he lives; the more he identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and his own de-sires. The spectacle's estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by the fact that the individual's gestures are no longer his own; they are the gestures of someone else who represents them to him. The spectator does not feel at home anywhere, because the spectacle is everywhere. P16

THE SPECTACLE's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial pro-duction. The "growth" generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was at its origin. P16

36
THE FETISHISM of the commodity - the domination of society by "intangible as well as tangible things" - attains its ultimate fulfilment in the spectacle, where the real world is replaced by a selection of images which are projected above it, yet which at the same time succeed in making themselves regarded as the epitome of reality. P19
Quantitative development over qualitative. P19
Economic growth has liberated societies from the natural pressures that forced them into a mediate struggle survival; but they have not yet been liberated from their liberator. P20
The commodity‚Äôs independence has spread to the entire economy it now dominates. This economy has transformed the world, but it has merely transformed it into a work dominated by the economy. Labour is forever in its service. P21
THE SPECTACLE is the stage at which the commodity has succeeded in totally colonizing social life. Commodification is not only visible, we no longer see anything else; the world we see is the world of the commodity. Modern economic production extends its dictatorship both extensively and intensively. P21
STARS - SPECTACULAR representations of living human beings - project this general banality into images of permitted roles. As specialists of apparent life, stars serve as superficial objects that people can identify with in order to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations that they actually live. The function of these celebrities is to act out various lifestyles or socio-political viewpoints in a full, totally free manner. They embody the inaccessible results of social labour by dramatising the by-products of that labour which are magically projected above it as its ultimate goals: power and vacations - the decision making and consumption that are at the beginning and the end of a process that is never questioned. On one hand, a governmental power may per-sonalise itself as a pseudostar; on the other, a star of consumption may campaign for recognition as a pseudopower over life. But the activities of these stars are not really free, and they offer no real choices. P29
67
THE SATISFACTION that no longer comes from using the commodities produced in abundance is now sought through recognition of their value as commodities. Consumers are filled with religious fervour for the sovereign freedom of commodities whose use has become an end in itself. Waves of enthusiasm for particular products are propagated by all the communications media. A film sparks a fashion craze; a magazine publicizes night spots which in turn spin off different lines of products. The proliferation of faddish gadgets reflects the fact that as the mass of commodities becomes increasingly absurd, absurdity itself becomes a commodity.
Trinkets such as key chains which come as free bonuses with the purchase of some luxury product, but which end up being traded back and forth as valued collectibles in their own right, reflect a mystical self-abandonment to commodity transcendence. Those who collect the trinkets that have been manufactured for the sole purpose of being collected are accumulating commodity indulgences - glorious tokens of the commodity's real presence among the faithful. Reified people proudly display the proofs of their intimacy with the commodity. Like the old religious fetishism, with its convul-sionary raptures and miraculous cures, the fetishism of commodities generates its own moments of fervent exaltation. All this is useful for only one purpose: producing habitual submission. P33
68
THE PSEUDONEEDS imposed by modern consumerism cannot be opposed by any genuine needs or desires that are not themselves also shaped by society and its history. But commodity abundance represents a total break in the organic development of social needs. Its mechanical accumulation unleashes an unlimited artificiality which overpowers any living desire. The cumulative power of this autonomous artificiality ends up by falsifying all social life. P34
THE IMAGE of blisful social unification through consump sion merely postpones the consumer's awareness of the acted divisions until his next disillusionment with some particular commodity. Each new product is ceremoniously accaimed as a unique creation offering a dramatic shortcut to the promised land of total consummation. But as with the fashionable adoption of seemingly aristocratic first names which end up being given to virtually all individuals of the same age, the objects that promise uniqueness can be offered up for mass consumption only if they have been mass-produced.
The prestigiousness of mediocre objects of this kind is solely due to the fact that they have been placed, however briefly, at the centre of social life and hailed as a revelation of the un-fathomable purposes of production. But the object that was prestigious in the spectacle becomes mundane as soon as it is taken home by its consumer - and by all its other consumers.

Too late, it reveals its essential poverty, a poverty that inevitably reflects the poverty of its production. Meanwhile, some other object is already replacing it as representative of the system and demanding its own moment of acclaim. P34
Fixated on the delusory centre around which his world seems to move, the spectator no longer experiences life as a journey toward fulfilment and toward death. Once he has given up on really living he can no longer acknowledge his own death. Life insurance ads merely insinuate that he may be guilty of dying without having provided for the smooth continuation of the system following the resultant economic loss, while the promoters of the
"American way of death" stress his capacity to preserve most of the appearances of life in his post-mortem state. On all the other fronts of advertising bombardment it is strictly forbidden to grow old. Everybody is urged to economize on their
"youth-capital," though such capital, however carefully managed, has little prospect of attaining the durable and cumulative properties of economic capital. This social absence of death coincides with the social absence of life. P91
Thus Boorstin concludes that the situation he describes is caused by an unfortunate but almost fortuitous encounter of an excessive technology of image-diffusion with an excessive appetite for sensationalism on the part of today's public. This amounts to blaming the spectacle on modern man's excessive inclination to be a spectator.
Boorstin fails to see that the proliferation of the prefabricated "pseudo-events" he denounces flows from the simple fact that the overwhelming realities of present-day social existence prevent people from actually living events for them-selves. Because history itself haunts modern society like a spectre, pseudo-histories have to be concocted at every level in order to preserve the threatened equilibrium of the present frozen time. P110
IDEOLOGY Is the intellectual basis of class societies within the conflictual course of history. Ideological expressions have never been pure fictions; they represent a distorted consciousness of realities, and as such they have been real factors that have in turn produced real distorting effects. This interconnection is intensified with the advent of the spectacle - the materialization of ideology brought about by the concrete success of an autonomised system of economic production - which virtually identifies social reality with an ideology that has remoulded all reality in its own image.

there's self and then there's culture. Two separate things. It's the self that wants to become perfect, and it's our culture that tells it what 'perfect' actually is. P20
Selfless acts are most often made on behalf of our people. P37
The celebrated mythologist Joseph Campbell explained this principle well: 'Whether you call someone a hero or a monster is all relative to where the focus of your consciousness may be. A German [fighting in WWII] is as much a hero as the American who was sent over there to kill him.‚Äô P37
'The brains we have and the psychology those brains produce is important,' he told me, but it doesn't explain many of the things we'd like to explain, whereas culture and society do.' To what extent, then, are we the culture we're born into? 'In one sense, I'd say culture is about go per cent of what we are.‚Äô P55
So the brain is a storyteller and it's also a hero-maker - and the hero that it makes is you. But the hero it makes and the plot it shapes your life around are not created in a void. The brain is a plagiarist, stealing ideas from the stories that surround it, then incorporating them into its self. Like John Pridmore and the ancient biblical tales he adopted, we absorb the stories that flow around our culture and use them to make sense of our past, our future, and to help us figure out who we are and who we want to be. We use them to construct our 'narrative identity'. P66
The storyteller inside us, then, is heavily influenced by the culture it's immersed in. From the fairy tales we hear as chil-dren, to films and works of literature, to the documentaries and news stories that narrativize the world more directly, to ancient parables in holy books, stories work as both entertainment and a kind of shopping mall of the self. 'Culture provides each person with an extensive menu of stories about how to live,' writes McAdams, 'and each of us chooses from the menu.' We build our sense of who we are by 'appropriating stories from culture'. Turning our lives into myth, he writes, 'is what adulthood is all about'. Our story gives our life meaning and purpose. It distracts us from the chaos and hopelessness and dread of the truth. P67
For the descendants of Confucius, reality is not a collection of individual objects but a field of interconnected forces. This means that East Asians tend to be more aware of what's happening in their environment: they'll see the whole picture, not merely its subject. They'll also understand that behaviour can be caused by the forces of the situation one finds oneself in, whereas an Aristotelian thinker, focused on individual objects and the powers they possess, is more likely to assume that a person acts as they do because they willed it. And so it's been found, in study after study. P72
So far, the researchers who study the 'geography of thought have revealed the extent to which where we are shapes who we are. The sort of person we become depends, to a great extent, on who we need to be in our particular environment. But that's not to say that individual men and women don't have the power to change us too. To argue this would be to deny the effect that Jesus, Aristotle, Confucius and all the other remarkable cultural leaders we're to meet on this journey have had on us. The fact is that when we're working out who we need to be in order to get along and get ahead, we're not just taking our information from stories. Being tribal animals, we're also constantly scanning our environment for people who seem to have, in some way, mastered the secrets of a successful life. The ideal self we're looking for doesn't only exist in fiction and gossip, it's also right there in front of us. And these people can be a powerful source of influence. The psychologist Professor Joseph Henrich writes that the 'cultural learning' that comes from those around us reaches directly into our brains and changes the neurological values we place on things and people, and in doing so, it also sets the standards by which we judge our-selves. P94
Our brains identify these leaders by being alert to various
'cues' that they, and the people around them, display. A basic cue we look for is 'self-similarity, for the straightforward reason that we're more likely to learn salient things by deciding to follow people who are like us in some fundamental way. (Our instinct to be drawn to and mimic those who are similar to ourselves is, sadly, yet another way that we're automatically tribal.) Another cue is age, which is especially important for children. Physical dominance is a cue that can be traced back to our primal ancestors and was, of course, John Pridmore's favoured method of exerting influence. But we also hunt for two more mercurial qualities that do much to explain not only the way in which individuals end up having outsized effects on their culture, but the often barmy world of celebrity we inhabit today. These cues are successful and prestige. P94/95
the 'Paris Hilton effect'. Because we're wired to direct our attention towards the people who are already the subject of attention, we'll sometimes be drawn to people in the media without really knowing why. But our being drawn to them makes the media focus on them even more. We then attend to them more, then the media attends to them more, and then there's a runaway effect, a feedback loop, in which the status of an essentially nondescript person becomes madly amplified.
So we copy people. We're helplessly drawn to them. We identify the ones who seem to know best how to get along and get ahead, we watch them, we listen to them, we open our selves to their influence. And then we'll often internalize the things they've taught us. They have become absorbed into our model of the perfect self. They are now part of us. And, so, culture spreads. P97
'At its very simplest, a self is a way that we can make sense of the things that happen to us,' he told me, leaning back in his chair with his legs crossed out in front of him. 'You need to have a sense of self in order to organize your life events into a meaningful story.' The notion that you have a soul, he explained, is an illusion. We feel as if we have a magical centre, a special core in which our moment-by-moment life is experienced. But there is no centre. There is no core. There is no soul. We experience our thoughts as if we're somehow listening to them, but as the philosopher Julian Baggini has observed, our minds are just one perception or thought after another, one piled on another. You, the person, is not separate from these thoughts.‚Äô P142
'I am not what I think I am and I am not what you think I am; 1 am what I think that you think I am.' The illusion is thought to take form at around the age of two. 'That's when you start to have autobiographical memories,' he told me. Then, in most cases, at around two to three years of age, children start interacting with other children, competing with them and joining groups. To participate usefully in a social arrangement, you have to have a sense of who you are, you have to have a sense of identity, and that sense of identity is a self. That must be constructed by the contextual information - Who am I? Which groups do I belong to? - as well as the biological ones - Am I a boy or a girl? Am I black or white? - or whatever. You then merge these and form in-groups. You start to develop prejudices and biases. You become pre-occupied with what others think about you. Your sense of self worth is a reflection of what you think other people think about you. As you spend more and more time with other children, you start to develop hierarchies.‚Äô P143
With these hierarchies comes our obsessional concern with status. 'We constantly seek validation. Why do we buy the fast cars? Why do we own the big yachts? Why do we need all these things that we don't really need? It's because we're signalling to others our self-status. If others believe we're fancy and great, our looking-glass self interprets that as evidence that we are fancy and great. We're self-conscious. We use clues from out there to tell us who we are in here. P143
As we travel through our days and lives, then, we're being continually changed by the situations we're in and the personalities that orbit us. The people around us create a kind of psychic mould that we expand into. This notion that we have a coherent self with integrity is slightly undermined by the fact that under different circumstances in different events we behave in totally different ways,' Bruce told me. These different selves reflect the fact that these are different social environments that we're occupying. P145
What all this work suggests is that a foundational idea of the Humanistic Psychologists is simply wrong - there is no authentic core to us, no essential, happy and perfect version of the self that can be exposed by stripping back the repressing expectations of society. In fact, the self is modular. We're made up of many competing selves, all of which are equally 'us', and which fight for dominance. Different versions of us emerge depending on where we are, what we're doing, who we're with and how aroused we happen to be. Our sense of who we actu ally are turns out to be critically dependent on what we believe others think of us. This brings to mind what Rory at the Suicide Lab told me about social perfectionism: 'It's nothing to do with What people actually think of you. It's what you think other people expect. The idea of the Looking-Glass Self exposes the social perfectionist in every one of us. We all judge ourselves by looking into the eyes of other people and imagining what they're thinking. P147
Adolescence is the break between the delusions of childhood and the delusions of adulthood, a time when the projects of one phase of life have broken down and the next have yet to emerge. And in that gap we glimpse the horrors that our storytelling brains work so hard to keep from us. I wish my storytelling brain worked better. I want some more of that delusion. P155
Today's young people have grown up in an era in which the markets have been freed to rule, and free markets favour the selfstarting business-person who relies on their own hard work and guile for survival. This generation have internalized the neoliberal economy. It's become a chief characteristic of who they are and who they want to be. 'We live in a time where market rhetoric, for better or for worse, and probably more for worse, has become almost pop cultural, the anthropologist Professor Alice Marwick told me. 'People are interested in entrepreneurship as a general social value. They're admiring celebrities for their hustle, avidly following things like which album or movie makes the most money or who's the most highly paid. There's a sense you go after corporate money, and that way you're independent and no one can tell you anything.
But what that really means is we're allowing the norms and values of corporations to dictate how we behave in our daily lives.'
In the age of perfectionism we're more likely to simply accept we shouldn't rely on the collective organism, whether it be government or corporation, to take responsibility for us.
We've really moved away from companies taking responsibility for training employees and keeping them for years and years; she said. 'We reward this almost constant stream of freelancers, where you're only at a company for a year or two and you're responsible for keeping your skill set up to date and if you don't do that, and you can't get a job, that's your fault. It's not the slat's fault for not taking care of its citizens, it's your fault for not keeping up with what's expected of you. I think people have really bought into this idea. P261
wasn't about being up on the economic theory or parsing the detail of campaign speeches or pondering the puzzle of the poor voting for a man who'd likely remove even more of their protections. The brain, after all, isn't especially interested in facts and data. We live our lives in story mode. Our minds make sense of the world using simplistic observations of cause and effect. They confabulate, weaving a useful, makes-sense narrative out of what they're feeling and seeing that casts their owners in a heroic light. As well as this, they're often tribal, making automatic allies of those who look and think like them, and enemies of those who don't. P278
Communication told me that the cycle of constantly needing it is. 'What's dangerous about getting accustomed to constant social feedback and constantly being told you're pretty is that when it gets cut off, you start to feel bad about yourself. You need that hit.' Not only does the fact that our mobile phones are always with us exacerbate this problem, so does the structure of social media platforms that place us on the same stream, and afford us the same space, as world-famous celebrities. It invites us to feel a kind of equivalence with them and to compare ourselves to them. What's more, because the new famous are partly comprised of reality TV and social media stars, they seem much more like us than the old-fashioned species. 'For a long time, Hollywood starlets were elevated to the level of untouchable,' Fox told me. 'We always knew these were people who were genetically gifted and more talented than we are. But now anyone can be a star and that makes everyone thirsty. P296/297
It's on the internet, in particular, that the beliefs of others are policed, their heresies loudly punished. It occurred to me that this might be the next irresistible step on the road we've taken: if we are all gods, then our feelings are sacred, and if our feelings are sacred, the people who hurt them must be sinners.
It felt as if, at the heart of all this, there was something inherently narcissistic - that our perspective is so precious we feel justified in silencing or punishing those who don't share it. P301
One remarkable feature of this new discord is the language students are using to denote injury. They speak of challenges to their points of view as acts of 'violence' or 'abuse' which leave them 'unsafe and 'traumatized'. It's as if their inner self, their 'soul', is so precious as to be sacrosanct. Also notable is the me-focused direction of much of their political activity. Whereas older generations protested in empathy with distant peoples - in apartheid South Africa, in Vietnam, in Biafra and in solidarity with those in Latin America or the Caribbean who were suffering as a result of US foreign policy - today's privileged, angry students seem far more preoccupied with changing the world for themselves and those near them. P302
Western culture prefers us not to believe we're defined or limited. It wants us to buy the fiction that the self is open, free, nothing but pure, bright pos-sibility; that we're all born with the same suite of potential abilities, as neural 'blank slates', as if all human brains come off the production line at Foxconn. This seduces us into accepting the cultural lie that says we can do anything we set our minds to, that we can be whoever we want to be. This false idea is of immense value to our neoliberal economy. The game it compels us to play can best be justified morally if all the contestants start out with an equal shot at winning. Moreover, if we believe we're all the same, this legitimizes calls for deregulated corporations and smaller government: it means that the men and women who lose simply didn't want it badly enough, that they just didn't believe - in which case, why should anyone else catch their fall? P329
Individualsm makes us a bla exits, that be For us, blame is an obict in space, a thing that exists one belongs to someone.
When e decide that it's ours, or somebody else's, we act in tenerance of the impossie addicts, the ature of why anybody behaves as they do. Of the addicts, the homeless, the violent, the obese, of those whose circumstances lead them into the utter darkness of prison, we're quick to condemn and slow to forgive. Ifa thing is what it is, then the thing you are, when you
fail, is bad.
It's easy to see why we might be unconsciously drawn to this idea. It's been in the air since at least 500 BC, when the Greeks formed the individualist view of the perfectible self that still entrances us today. Bewitched by our culture, we expect others to be rational and always in control of their behaviour.
We respond with disbelief and outrage when they disappoint.
But people aren't what we think they are. We're not all constructed from the same precision-tooled machine parts. We haven't all been equally, perfectly designed to face the challenges of our environment. We're lumps of biology, mashed and pounded into shape by mostly chance events. Our 'human potential is limited.
But this isn't the model of self that our culture keeps showing us. Instead, we're presented with an individual who has total free will and an ability to become whoever they choose.
And who they usually choose to be is an extraverted, slim, indi-vidualistic, optimistic, hard-working, popular, socially aware yet high-self-esteeming individual with entrepreneurial guile - all characteristics Ayn Rand would've recognized as heroic.
Because they're Greek, these cultural heroes will be beautiful both inside and out, and moving in the direction of perfection.
Because they're Christian, they'll have clean and goodly interior selves. Because they're humanistic, they'll be authentic and.
'real' and take responsibility for everything that happens to them. Because they're neoliberal, they'll be self sufficient and successful and following their dreams with a ferocious hunger. P330
Daniel Nettle writes that extraverts are 'highly active people who can lay their hands on vast stores of energy in pursuit of goals, are
'prepared to work very hard in pursuit of fame or money' and enjoy 'gaining status, receiving social attention'. He could be describing an ideal of self from Ancient Greece or a neoliberal hero.
As we've learned, it's not a coincidence that this model of ideal self also happens to be the one best equipped to get along and get ahead in the age of perfectionism - this era of heightened individualism, of financial crisis, of rising inequality, of personal debt, of small state, of deregulation, of austerity, of gig economy, of zero-hours contracts, of perfection-demanding gender ideals, of declining wages, of unrealistic body-image goals, of social media with its perfectionist presentation and its tribal outrage and demands for public punishment. These are the kinds of people who'll be more likely to win at the game that has been made of our world, the kinds who'll find a place in the boardroom or found billion-dollar hedge funds or startups - and then become powerful consumers, feeding back into the machine. This is who our modern tribal environment wants us to be. P331
Stopping the war of perfection that's happening in your head is just the first step. Once you've quit trying to be who you're not, you can make an assessment of the things you're doing with your life. Professor Little, in his study of 'personal projects', argues that it's crucial to understand our limitations so that we can pursue goals that recognize them. 'We need to invest in those projects that bring meaning to us but which are achievable,' he told me. 'And if they're not achievable, then you don't just give up and say, "Life's wretched," you think of other ways of having a meaningful life. Change your goals.
What he's describing is a way of changing how we feel without having to change who we are. This is the way I've come to think of it: put a lizard on an iceberg and it's miserable. Now release it into the Sahara. The core of who that lizard is hasn't altered in the slightest and yet it's become happy. Its experience of life, but not its self, has transformed. If we want to inch towards happiness, then, we should stop trying to change ourselves and start trying to change our environment - the things we're doing with our lives, the people we're sharing it with, the goals we have. We should find projects to pursue which are not only meaningful to us, but over which we have efficacy. It doesn't have to be our job, it doesn't have to be something grandiosely altruistic, it just has to be us. P333


### The Cold Start Problem

A telephone without a connection at the other end of the line is not even a toy or a scientific instrument. It is one of the most useless things in the world. Its value depends on the connection with the other telephone and increases with the number of connections. P20
the form of "networked product"-but the distinction is important. A successful network effect requires both a product and its network, and that was true in the age of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, and true today. For Uber, the "product" is the app that people run on their phones, and the "network" refers to all the active users at any given time who are connecting with Uber to drive or ride. In contemporary parlance, the product is typically made of software whereas the network is typically made of people. P20
Anti-network effects are the negative force that drives new networks to zero. While the industry tends to focus on the positive results of network effects, at their inception, network effects are a destructive force, driven by a vicious‚Äînot virtuous‚Äîcycle where new users churn because not enough other users are there yet. For Slack, it doesn't make sense to use the product until your colleagues are also on the platform. For Uber, you can't use the service until there are enough drivers, who won't drive until there are enough rides. This first stage of creating a network is the hardest, and some will call it a "chicken and egg" situation or needing to "bootstrap" a community. I call it the "Cold Start Problem." P63
Solving the Cold Start Problem requires a team to launch a network and quickly create enough density and breadth such that the user e. perience can improve in leaps and bounds. In Slack's case, you can think of it as how likely it is that the person you're looking for within your company uses Slack, and how likely it is they'll reply. If the network is small and sparse, you may not be able to message who you want, or when you do, because they use it infrequently, they won't reply quickly. Your coworker will just wonder why you didn't send them an email.

If you add more people, but add the wrong people, then it still won't be enough. You need the right people on the network. Ten people using Slack all from the same team is better than ten random people in a larger company. Density and interconnectedness is key. P68
The concept of an atomic network is immediately obvious here. Although Bank of America served all of California, they didn't focus on trying to launch across the entire state at once, but rather, they focused on Fresno, a town where they had a high degree of penetration. On top of that, they focused on a moment in time-Bank of America issued all the credit cards on the same day, so that there would be a tipping point of people with the cards in their wallets, ready to use them. And after getting the cards in the hands of consumers, they focused on a specific segment of small merchants in the downtown corridor of the town, To complete the other side of the network. P73
Whether for credit cards, multiplayer games, or business collaboration. software, the "atomic network" is the smallest network needed that can stand on its own. It needs to have enough density and stability to break through early anti-network effects, and ultimately grow on its own. I liken it to an atom because it is the unit upon which larger networks are ultimately built. If you can build one, and then another, you can build the rest of the network‚Äîthis is the base unit to build everything else. P74
Whereas our typical business verbiage revolves around aggregations of millions of people ‚Äî that‚Äôs usually what we mean when we talk about "markets," "segments," and "demographics" ‚Äîthe language of launch. ing new networks should be focused on groupings of a handful of peo-ple, with the right intent, in the right situation, at the right time. This is true in dating apps, marketplaces, but even in workplace products. The wedge begins with "The Q2 planning cycle in the Product team at
Chase Bank." P78
Why is there a hard side at all? Hard sides exist because there are tasks in any networked product that just require more work, whether that's selling products, organizing projects, or creating content. Users on the hard side have complex workflows, expect status benefits as well as financial outcomes, and will try competitive products to compare. As a result, their expectations are higher, and it's difficult to engage and retain them. P84
In Spiegel's pyramid, people have emotional needs‚Äîwhether that's self-expression, status, or communication-and create different forms of content to achieve them. Sending an ephemeral photo is easy, particularly a selfie on the go, which anyone can do. But spending hours to learn a new TikTok dance is difficult, and not everyone can do it. The more difficult the work needed to be part of the hard side of a network, the smaller the percentage of users who will participate. P87
The key insight in the stories of Homobiles or Tinder is‚Äîhow do you find a problem where the hard side of a network is engaged, but their needs are unaddressed? The answer is to look at hobbies and side hustles. P96
The idea is to start with these underserved segments‚Äîwhose users may not be very attractive customers on their own‚Äîand to apply Clayton Christensen's disruption theory. New products often disrupt markets by starting on the low end, providing "good enough" func-tionality, and growing from there into the medium, and eventually into the core market of the incumbents. Recently, the opposite trend has emerged‚Äîproducts like Uber and email company Superhuman, have started at the top of the market as a luxury product, and worked their way down. P97
Networked products are fundamentally different from the typical product experience‚Äîthey facilitate experiences that users have with each other, whereas traditional products emphasize how users interact with the software itself. They grow and succeed by adding more users, which create network effects, whereas traditional products grow by building better features and supporting more use cases. It's why products like Twitter and Zoom and others often seem so simple, and are critiqued as "features not products" that seem trivial at first. They have one magical core experience. Contrast this to traditional products, which often win the "checkmark contest" bake-offs common in enterprise software purchases, but lose in the contest of actual product engagement from their end users. P103
many early investors balked at the fact that Zoom was tackling what they perceived as a solved problem. The commonality between all these networked products is that they offered novel ways for people to interact, and over time, the network became the defensibility.
In other words, the ideal product to drive network effects combines both factors: The product idea itself should be as simple as possible-easily understandable by anyone as soon as they encounter it. And at the same time, it should simultaneously bring together a rich, complex, infinite network of users that is impossible to copy by competitors.
Zoom, of course, is a fantastic example of this ideal. P106
This is a recurring theme across business models because of the Cold Start Problem. Charging customers directly is a straightforward way to generate revenue, but it adds friction for every new user to join the network. It's hard enough to build an atomic network; why make it even harder by erecting barriers? Without being able to build out a network quickly, growth channels like virality are more muted. If Zoom charged every user with no free tier, it might have generated more revenue in the short run, but would likely have needed to spend more on marketing and sales to compensate. Freemium is an essential part of Zoom's appeal and ability to grow.
And once Zoom had the right ingredients ‚Äîa simple, killer product-its business model then provided the revenue and business model to leverage viral growth. P108
It becomes obvious when a product has solved the Cold Start Problem-the experience starts to really work. When you open a workplace collaboration app during a meeting, all the relevant tasks are in there, and your coworkers are chatting away about next steps. Or when you open a social app, engaging and entertaining content is there on your feed.
You have notifications because your friends have already commented on your new photos. A marketplace app might start to feel like it has every-thing, like it's fully comprehensive. Search for any product, and dozens of relevant listings show, and they're cheap, high quality, and shippable same day.
When the network is fully filled out, active, and people are connected in the right way, then the product experience can really shine. This is the Magic Moment, when a product can deliver its core value ‚Äîwhether that's connecting people for work, entertainment, dating, games, or otherwise. A product that hasn't yet solved its Cold Start Problem will fail to deliver any magic in its early days. P111
The Magic Moment is a nice concept, but it would be even more useful if you could measure it. The way to best do this might be surprising-you start with the opposite of magic, the moments where the network has broken down, and you start solving the problem from there. P116
Gmail first launched as an invite-only product on April Fool's in
2004. It offered a gigabyte of storage at a time when others were offering megabytes of storage. The original idea wasn't to create hype, but rather something more practical-the infrastructure running Gmail couldn't support a fast ramp on the number of users, so an invite-only strategy was utilized:
Gmail ended up running on three hundred old Pentium III computers nobody else at Google wanted. That was sufficient for the limited beta rollout the company planned, which involved giving accounts to a thousand outsiders, allowing them to invite a couple of friends apiece, and growing slowly from there?
However, it soon became clear the product was going to be a hit-George Harik, one of the first ten employees at Google said:
Once it was clear that Gmail was the real deal, the invitations became a hot property. The limited rollout had been born of neces-sity, but " it had a side effect. Everyone wanted it even more. It was hailed as one of the best marketing decisions in tech history, but it was a little bit unintentional."
People began to buy and sell invites to Gmail:
Bidding for invites on eBay sent prices shooting up to $150 and be-yond; sites such as Gmail Swap emerged to match up those with invites with those who desperately wanted them. Having a Hotmail or Yahoo Mail email address was slightly embarrassing; having a Gmail one meant that you were part of a club most people couldn't get into.
It might seem silly to fight for early access, but there are permanent benefits for getting on in the first few months. Earlier users could grab the username that they wanted. An address like frank@gmail.com. P137
Invite-only is a powerful strategy. When executed well, the people in an initial atomic network become a magnet for even more users. allows a network to copy and paste itself many times over, attracting more and more adjacent networks over time.
Just as creators of new products spend endless hours designing the experience, creators of networked products have an additional task: curating the right people so that the experience of a new member joining the community, marketplace, or other network is just right. A good product designer wouldn't allow a random set of feature ideas to be added to the final version of a new app, and in the same way, a mindful designer of networks wouldn't allow a random set of users to initially join. Had LinkedIn started with an undesirable set of users, it likely would not have become a magnet for the true believers that continued to onboard their friends over time. Had Tinder begun somewhere besides USC‚Äîlet's say in a small rural town ‚Äîit wouldn't have been able to build campus to campus, and then large cities and then on from there. It would have changed the whole strategy. For networked products, the curation of the network-who's on it, why they're there, and how they interact with each other-is as important as its product design. Starting with a deliberate point of view on who's best for your network will define its magnetism, culture, and ultimate trajectory. P140
A popular strategy for bootstrapping networks is what I like to call "come for the tool, stay for the network." The idea is to initially attract users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company. P145
The levers you use to increase the engagement of an infrequent user are different than deepening engagement for a power user. Early users might just need a few more connections to colleagues at their company. Power users might need to discover advanced features on search, recruiting, and creating groups, so that they have new and more powerful ways to connect with people. Segmenting our users gives us the granularity to connect the right features and user education to impact their usage. P203
In Dropbox's case, this segmentation revealed that a user who has installed the product across multiple devices- home and work compu ers, or on their mobile devices‚Äîis more valuable than someone who jus has a single device and uses the service for backup. Better yet, high-mahe users often share folders and collaborate with other users, particular for work purposes. As I described earlier, Dropbox segmented their us ers by value-High-Value Actives and Low-Value Actives, as opposed to LinkedIn's frequency-oriented segmentation. To encourage users to take these high-value actions, Dropbox could improve the functionality of syncing and sharing. It could send or show educational content, showing users the fastest way to get set up on multiple devices. Or it could use incentives - free storage, for instance-to compel users to properly set up their accounts. P204
Conceptualizing network effects in this manner helps us understand why the Cold Start Problem exists, from a user's point of view. If the network is too sparse, the loop is broken‚Äînot enough users will see a photo to reply with likes, and not enough buyers will see a listing to purchase a product. If a loop is broken, then the user churns, which further cascades the network problem. Users need to trust the loop to rely on it. If the network is too small or too inactive and the loop breaks, then users will be less likely to use it in the future. After all, if you text a friend on a new messaging app and they don't respond, or if you share a document at work but don't get a reply, then trust goes down. But in the positive case, if a network scales and the connections get denser, then the loop gets tighter ‚Äîcontent creators get more social feedback, marketplace sellers get more purchases at higher prices, and users of workplace tools can effectively collaborate with their coworkers. P205
The Engagement network effect has the superpower of being able to reactivate churned users, which in turn grows the active user count. Based on data I've seen from startups, a typical product might only have 25-50 percent of its registered users active in any given month, expressed as a ratio of actives divided by signups. In other words, up to 75 percent of users are inactive at any given point, most of whom will never come back. The ability to reactivate users provides a powerful counterweight to churn, keeping this ratio in check over time. This is an important tool that is unique to networked products. Traditional products that lack networks often struggle with this, because they rely on spammy emails, discounts, and push notifications to entice users back. This usually doesn't work, and company-sent communications rank among the lowest clickthrough rate messages. Networked products, on the other hand, have the unique capability to reactivate these users by enlisting active users to bring them back. Even if you don't open the app on a given day, other users in the network may incar-act with you-commenting or liking your past content, or sending you a message. Getting an email notification that says your boss just shared a folder with you is a lot more compelling than a marketing message. A notification that a close friend just joined an app you tried a month ago is a lot more engaging than an announcement about new features. And the more dense the network is around a chumed user, the more likely they are to receive this type of interaction. p206/207
When teams are asked to improve their product's retention rate, they often think that the answer will lie in some magical product improve-ment. The Engagement network effect, and its underlying loops, provide a systematic way to tackle the problem.
The early work on scurvy gave us the foundational tools. But instead of providing citrus and measuring for malnutrition, tech companies can reason by analogy: create user cohorts by levels of engagement, and analyze what differentiates high value users from lower value ones. These start out as correlations, so use A/B testing to prove causality-once the best levers are found, test many variations of these ideas. Rinse and repeat, to systematically strengthen the Engagement network effect. The good news is that the Engagement Effect will automatically kick in as colleagues, influencers, and other people join the network But getting these people onboard can be its own challenge. P208 
Networked products are unique because they can embed their viral growth into the product experience itself. When a product like Dropbox has a built-in feature like folder sharing, it can spread on its own. PayPal's badges and core user-to-user payments accomplishes the same. This is the Product/Network Duo at work again, where the product has features to attract people to the network, while the network brings more value to the product. Workplace collaboration products like Slack ask you to invite your colleagues into your chat, and photo-sharing apps like Instagram make it easy to invite and connect to your Facebook friends. They can tap into your phone's contacts, integrate with your company's internal employee directory, or tap into the sharing widgets built into your phone. This is software, not just building a buzzy, shareable video. P213/214
At the same time this is happening, the network itself is changing.
As a network grows, often the hard side of the network gets even more concentrated and powerful, and begins to act accordingly. Uber's power drivers are its most important users, and the company faced a tough situation when they came together to demand higher pay, benefits, and other changes. As I describe in "When the Network Revolts," it becomes incredibly hard to keep everyone happy.
While the hard side evolves, the rest of the network is changing as well. Early communities are often special, curated and molded to share attractive norms and qualities. Slack launched to a market of leading startups for a reason, as did Tinder with their college-by-college strat-egy. As I describe in "Eternal September," there's an unfortunate downside in reaching a more mainstream audience: more and more people jump in, and what makes the early community special often gets diluted. P241
New products initially grow just by adding more customers‚Äî to grow a network, add more nodes. Eventually this stops working because nearly everyone in the target market has joined the network, and there are not enough potential customers left. From here, the focus has to shift from adding new customers to layering on more services and revenue opportunities with existing ones. P253
In my conversations with Bangaly on this topic, he described his approach as a systematic evaluation of the network of networks that constituted Instagram. Rather than focusing on the core network of Power Users-the loud and vocal minority that often drive product decisions-instead the approach was to constantly figure out the adjacent set of users whose experience was subpar.
There might be multiple sets of nonfunctional adjacent networks at any given time, and it might require different approaches to fix each one. For some networks, it might be the features of the product, like Instagram not having great support for low-end Android apps. Or it might be because of the quality of their networks- if the right content creators or celebrities hadn't yet arrived. You fix the experience for these users, then ask yourself again, who are the adjacent users? P258
The Law of Shitty Clickthroughs says every marketing channel degrades over time. This means lower clickthrough, engagement, and conversion rates, regardless of if you're talking about email, paid marketing, social media, or video. This is a core reason why products hit growth ceilings-when marketing channels stop performing, the growth curve starts to bend downward. p265
The same can be found for nearly all growth channels over time. At the micro level, an individual marketing campaign will typically see declining clickthrough rates over time‚Äîso teams have to refresh the mes-saging, images, and channels. At a more macro level, channels like email or paid marketing degrade over years, though some channels fall even quicker-like the Zynga + Facebook platform era of the 2010s, which dropped off in months, not years. Why does this happen? Consumers acclimate to specific brands, marketing techniques, and messaging, and tune them out. P267
When Wimdu launched, the Samwers reached out to Airbnb to discuss combining forces, as they had done with Groupon and eBay to facilitate a speedy exit. Discussions ensued between Airbnb and Wimdu cofounders and investors-meeting multiple times, touring the Widu offices, and checking with other founders like Andrew Mason from Groupon to best understand the potential outcome. In the end, Airbnb chose to fight. Brian Chesky described his thought process:

‚ÄúMy view was, my biggest punishment, my biggest revenge on you is, I'm gonna make you run this company long term. So you had the baby, now you gotta raise the child. And you're stuck with it for 18 years. Because I knew he wanted to sell the company.
I knew he could move faster than me for a year, but he wasn't gonna keep doing it. And so that was our strategy. And we built the company long term. And the ultimate way we won is, we had a better community. He couldn't understand community. And I think we had a better product.‚Äù P316
This happens because networked products can lean toward "win. ner take all. When one product emerges as the winner in an atomic network, tha's just the group choosing their favorite app. But repeat that enough times, and that becomes the playbook for a product to win across the entire market‚Äîand that's a monopoly. This happens because within an atomic network of users, whether they are friends or colleagues, it's common to standardize on a single product for conve-nience. For example, within the workplace, a team and sometimes an entire company will converge on the same set of products. They will use the same collaboration tools to store important documents, message coworkers, or edit spreadsheets. A single app in each category tends to receive the lion's share of engagement, so that the team that uses Slack will not spend an equal amount of time in Microsoft Teams as well-it's usually one or the other. One product eventually dominates, at least within that particular network.
If a networked product can begin to win over a series of networks faster than its competition, then it develops an accumulating advantage.
These advantages, naturally, manifest as increasing network effects across customer acquisition, engagement, and monetization. Smaller networks might unravel and lose their users, who might switch over. Naturally, it becomes important for every player to figure out how to compete in this type of high-stakes environment. But how does the competitive playbook work in a world with network effects?
First, I'll tell you what it's not: it's certainly not a contest to see who can ship more features. In fact, sometimes the products seem roughly the same. P324
When examined through the lens of Meerkat's Law and the central framework of this book, it is obvious why the resulting networks generated by big launches are weak. You'd rather have a smaller set of atomic networks that are denser and more engaged than a large number of networks that aren't there. When a networked product depends on having other people in order to be useful, it's better to ignore the top-line aggregate numbers. Instead, the quality of the traction can only be seen when you zoom all the way into the perspective of an individual user within the network. Does a new person who joins the product see value based on how many other users are already on it? You might as well ignore the aggregate numbers, and in particular the spike of users that a new product might see in its first days. As Eric Ries describes in his book The Lean Startup, these are "vanity metrics." The numbers might make you feel good, especially when they are going up, but it doesn't matter if you have a hundred million users if they are churning out at a high rate, due to a lack of other users engaging. P343
When networks are built bottom-up, they are more likely to be densely interconnected, and thus healthier and more engaged. There are multiple reasons for this: A new product is often incubated within a subcommunity, whether that's a college campus, San Francisco techies, gamers, or freelancers- as recent tech successes have shown. It will grow within this group before spreading into other verticals, allowing time for its developers to tune features like inviting or sharing, while honing the core value proposition. Once a new networked product is spreading via word of mouth, then each user is likely to know at least one other user already on the network. By the time it reaches the broader con-sciousness, it will be seen as a phenomenon, and top-down efforts can always be added on to scale a network that's already big and engaged. P344


### You Have Not Heard Your Favourite Song Yet

Streaming is surveillance capitalism. 

At least, it's definitely capitalism. Whether it's 'surveillance' or not depends on whether you think that means something more than operating a system which inherently requires information exchange in order to function. When you hit play on a song, the app running on your phone or computer sends a message to the streaming service's servers. That message identifies the song you're trying to play, because that's the point, and the user-ID of your streaming account, because that's how the service can tell if you're allowed to play that song. When you hit pause or skip or switch to a different song, the app sends another message to the servers. These messages themselves aren't really surveilling you any more than a lightbulb is surveilling the switch that turns it on or off. Lightbulbs, however, don't keep logs of their ons and offs.
Actually, maybe smart bulbs do. A streaming service does. It has to, logistically and legally, because it has to pay royalties. P37
Except, of course, music is human and humans often have gender, and in most places in the world overall music tastes differ by age and gender almost as dramatically as they differ by country and language. It's thus a practical statistical advantage, from the point of view of a streaming service trying to recommend music to brand new listeners who haven't played anything yet, to give them music that other people of their country, age and gender already like. P39
As you listen, you either reinforce or refute these low-grade demographic inferences, and over time you assert your own listening patterns. The amount of data changes steadily, but the shape of it never really does. Spotify never knows your ethnicity, your poli-tics, your occupation, your income, your shopping patterns or your medications. It doesn't know what you tell Siri, or what you look up on WebMD. It doesn't cross-reference your Netflix queue or your YouTube subscriptions. It can't see that you're wearing a band t-shirt. It can't tell that the band t-shirt you're wearing is 35 years old, and it doesn't know that the guy on the left in the hat died yesterday, and it wouldn‚Äôt know which song you need to hear in your grief. P40/41
The moments when you step outside of your own assumptions about yourself, and become somebody slightly new, are too rare and too singular to optimize for. It's far easier, and far more reliable, to just feed you more of the already-familiar. P41
And this is the problem, rather than the promise, I think, of the myopically limited kind of surveillance that streaming services subject us to. They don't know our hidden secrets. They don't know how to find them out. Before we start listening, they can only guess that we are exactly like the people they've seen before, but they never learned that much about those people, either.
But they also barely know the unsecrets we try to share. They know what we play, but they can't see whether we're dancing enraptured while the music spins, or two rooms away folding distractingly crinkly laundry. They know which songs we put on playlists, but not what the playlists are for. They know when we play a song ten times, but not whether we're doing it because of the drums or in spite of the banjo. They know what we click on when we search, but not whether we knew what we were looking for. They can't tell whether we scroll past their offerings in disdain or distraction.
They can't distinguish between joy and irony, or whether we were driven away by the miserable song that was playing or torn away from a crescendoing new love by the sound of a cat, somewhere downstairs, throwing up into one of our shoes.
And they're not likely to start learning any of these things, because they don't need to. Your cat is your problem. You're not really being surveilled, but that's not due to teleological humility or ethical judiciousness, it's just that invasive surveillance doesn't address any business problem that isn't at once more easily and more effectively solved by regression to the mean. Automated serendipity is a hard bet, but it's also a bad bet. The lowest common denominator might sound like an aesthetic condemnation, but it's exactly the goal of factoring. Night Ranger's 'You Can Still Rock in America' isn't what I want to hear right now, but it definitely was once, and the nostalgia might be lazy and ineffective, but it's not offensive. I smile, and hum a little of that chorus to myself as I go oft, clicking ambiguously and cheerfully, in search of S√°mi yoiks or n dehou fusion or cat-calming music or whatever it is I alone know I want to hear next. P41/42
We know things about each other, our weaknesses and embarrassments and vulnerabilities as much as our powers and accomplishments and concealed contours. Facts accumulate into insights, and past observations lead to future in-tentions. At least, that's what happens in our brains.
That's not what happens inside of a computer. The computer may have a lot of your data, but it doesn't know about you, any more than a refrigerator knows about eggs. Fill a refrigerator entirely full of eggs, and it still doesn't know any more about eggs than when it was empty. P43
Algorithms can get a lot more complicated than that, but they never get any smarter. They do not seek out challenges, they do not think flexibly, they don't persevere to understand, and they don't construct or critique arguments. They basically permanently fail at all the foundational Habits of Mind from my kid's elementary school. They are not minds. They are, at most, symbolic machines.
And more often than not, these 'machines' are just math. 'Just' is a mean-spirited word to use for this, though. Math is very useful.
Symbolic machines can do extremely helpful symbolic work, and songs and fascinations are made of symbols.
Streaming music services are full of algorithms. If the most important thing to know about algorithms is that most of them are just math, the second-most important thing to realize about algorithms is that there is never just one. There is no 'Spotify Algorithm', there are different algorithms for almost every feature. Sometimes a single feature involves multiple algorithms. Almost everything in any online experience involves some kind of algorithm. P44
And although lots of these algorithms are simple, some of them are not only complicated, but complicated in humanly unmanageable ways. This family of complex algorithmic techniques is called machine learning, or ML for short. It has powers and drawbacks that we will discuss later, but it also has a bad name. Machines don't learn any more than they know, so when a human tells you a machine is learning, you can safely infer that nobody is learning.
Sometimes ML works despite this, and sometimes it causes chaos.
So the good news is that the robots are not plotting your downfall.
The robots have no domination plan, and indeed no plans at all, and anyway there are no robots. The bad news is that we can't blame robots when things go wrong. Wrong is a human direction.
You don't need to fear the fact that algorithms exist, or even the way they now surround you. P48
Almost inevitably, though, the biggest playlists tend to encounter variations on the same structural and cultural limitations as radio stations. Influence is garnered by demonstrating power, but to demonstrate power you have to concentrate it. RapCaviar currently has 50 songs, not 40, but it's the same circular premise.
RapCaviar is a big deal because getting on it means you reach tens of millions of listeners, and tens of millions of listeners follow it in order to know the hip hop that matters to those tens of millions of listeners. That only works if the playlist is short enough that everything on it gets played repeatedly. RapCaviar has the clout to break a new rapper, but it gets that clout by being the place where you go to find the hip hop that matters most, which means it mostly has to program music by rappers whose importance is already established. It has to change to stay current, but it can't abandon songs that still hold cultural status. It can break an independent rapper, but only in the context and company of the most major major-label artists, and this means it can't break a lot of them. P54
You can fear this. If you're a new artist trying to figure out how to make a living in music, it seems like a dauntingly hermetic system. Chance the Rapper, and the occasional similar stories, almost make it worse: they suggest that there is a principled and independent path to stardom, but don't explain how it can be walked. But this isn't a new fear, really. 'Step 5. Get on RapCaviar.' is only a minor variation on the old 'Step 5. Get signed.: probably no easier, but also probably no harder. In fact, most paths to 'Get on RapCaviar' still go through 'Get signed'. P54/55
So yes, it's true that the big gates still have keepers, and their uniforms smell a lot like the old ones. The winding, unguarded course up an implicit and shifting semi-hierarchical ladder of playlists isn't a real path, yet, not something you can just carefully follow to eventually cross over the wall. But it suggests a course of movement and effort that might feel more like climbing than like waiting to be airlifted by giant eagles. One stranger putting you on a rap playlist that five more strangers follow may not turn out to be the start of anything bigger for either of you, but it couldn't before, and now it could. P57
And because most people's listening is around the average amount, what effectively ends up happening is that the most active streamers get to say what happens to the money from people who are paying for subscriptions but not really using them. P63
It also has straightforward incentives for labels and artists: more streaming is always better. The label/artist incentives in a user-centric subscription scheme are kind of weird and ugly: you don't care how much your fans listen to your music, but you do want them to not listen to other artists. P63
On the whole, if more-active listeners listen to more-popular artists, then the pro rata scheme will be regressive in the economic (and social) sense, compared to the user-centric one, taxing the less-popular artists to consolidate wealth in the most-popular. Whereas if more-active listeners tend to listen to less-popular artists, then the pro rata scheme will be progressive, redistributing money from more-popular artists to less-popular ones. Thus this very basic question can be answered quantitatively by computing the average number of monthly streams per Spotify listener, and then calculating the average monthly total plays per artist of the artists played by listeners with fewer streams than that vs the ones with more. A ratio greater than I.o shows that pro rata is regressive, a ratio less than I.o shows that it's progressive, and either way it does so without revealing any remotely-proprietary actual counts or averages. When I monitored it at Spotify, it hovered around 0.83. More-active-than-average listeners play artists who are, on average, 0.83x as popular as the artists played by less-active-than-average listeners. The averages vary considerably across countries, and a little bit over time, and thus the ratio varies minorly in both dimensions as well, but not in magnitude or direc-tion. Pro rata is progressive, and user-centric would be regressive. P64
Explaining an algorithm is comforting in only a very limited and technical sense. The thing that puts recommendations' at the bottom of the playlist isn't trying to reinforce the power structures of decades of country radio, which it doesn't know about, even in the loose and mostly wrong sense in which it can be said to know anything at all. It not only doesn't know the genders of the artists, it doesn't even know their genres. It doesn't know any categorical difference between the words 'Country Music' and the words
'Theremin Frittata. It just knows that when other people have written those letters at the top of their playlists, they have tended to put these tracks below them. You can't blame math for the biases and flaws of society.
What you can blame, though, is the people who operate the math. We take a flawed world, and we try to reflect it back upon itself, but you can't reflect anything without changing its course.
This 'Country Music' case was, in technical terms, a simple matter of applied popularity bias in a situation where applying popularity bias is basically the mission statement of the feature to begin with. Statistical correlations aren't value-statements, though, and nobody was saying that those 135 manly country songs were more important or more culturally relevant to Country Music than Carrie Underwood or Martina McBride or Sara Evans. P88
Popularity not only reinforces the status quo, it usually mostly reports on it. P90
The SEO wars to dominate search results for box-fan noise are brutal, boch despite and because there is basically no way to make better' box-fan noises. The first tentative skirmishes of this war focused on what you might be searching for: 'fan noise, ocean sounds, Waves. But this quickly expanded to wky you might be searching: "an noise for sleeping, ocean sounds for meditation, Waves for studying. And from there to other, more conjectural premises: resonant frequencies for goal-affirmation, quiet rain storms for soothing babies, subliminal reinforcement for learning Mandarin. P97
Streaming and playlists are also sometimes blamed for requiring constant engagement, or rewarding only the artists willing to maintain an onerous level of non-musical fan-fascinating activity like social-media feeds and endless remixes. What about the artists (and again, the implication tends to be that these are the serious artists) who need two or three years of solitude to reach deep enough inside of themselves to find their next album? But I think this question presumes that all communities have the same dynamics, and that every artist with a slowly thoughtful artistic process is competing for the same fans as artists with fast ma-chinery. How can Zola Jesus' lonely, searching voice cut into the incessant din of BTS Army marches, for one plaintive example?
But that's not actually a problem Zola has. Competing for BTS's tans probably does require making relentless TikToks, because TikTok is an integral part of how those listeners find music that they listen to later, and how they express their reactions to their listening. Zola isn't doing that. BTS fans aren't the audience she's trying to reach, and her fans don't find music through hashtags or meme aesthetics. What she needs is a community of fans of diffi-cult, atmospheric music in search of obscure emotional truths. Or, having found such a community, once, she needs a way to find it again each time she comes back from her solitude with a new record. p109/110
It is now very possible to have a streaming music experience that is mostly managed by algorithms. It's not yet necessary. You can still treat a streaming service as a way of manually collecting individual songs from an infinite store if you insist, and the current share of listening programmed by algorithms is less than you might guess, but it seems pretty clear that algorithms are going to be enthusiastically present in music, and almost all aspects of technological life, for the foreseeable future. It is reasonable to be afraid of this. Algorithms are just tools, but sometimes their makers hand them to you and sometimes we strap you to a spinning board and throw them at your head. 
The algorithms don't care, either way. Only humans care.
Fortunately, we usually care a lot. We've gotten pretty good, collectively, at algorithms, and they often work. They make errors, too, but so do humans.
The ways in which algorithms fail, however, are different from the ways in which we're used to failing ourselves. People fail spectacularly by trying difficult things, but also fail sporadically at things that should be easy. Algorithms fail systematically by never knowing whether they're good at something or not. Even the best algorithms fail if they cannot distinguish bad from good, and thus cannot avoid giving bad answers along with good ones. P134/135
The name for letting computers do millions of things at once without laborious supervision is Machine Learning.
Conventional pre-Machine-Learning computer programming is done by humans writing some code and then tweaking it until the results are good. This assumes that someone on the team can tell better results from worse ones. You can't write conventional music-recommendation programs without knowing a lot about music.
The core idea of Machine Learning is that instead of telling the computer what to do, you tell it what the variables are, and how to judge the results, and you let some meta-algorithm find the combination of variables that produces the best results. Imagine a machine with a lot of levers. Instead of a human getting into the machine to operate the levers, they walk around to the front of the machine and explain the goals to it, and then the machine moves the levers itself. P138/139
Machine learning does for programming what microwave ovens did for cooking: they take a sensory craft based on feedback and adjustment, and replace it with a closed box that just beeps.
Saying you're a Machine Learning Engineer is like saying you're going to microwave anything you're given to cook. Microwaves in turn encourage frozen meals, and a whole ecosystem of non-cook-ing. We could microwave the cookies, too, come to think of it, allowing us to finally replace the last few troublesome work-slots in the company that used to require a domain-specific skill "baking", whatever that is).
By that point, the cookies probably suck. They don't have to, but they will have had a thousand chances to both get worse and be more profitable, and there are no cookie experts left to defend the original cookie principles. The engineers, however, won't mind.
They get to work on cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms instead of arguing with weird cooking-school graduates. They get to talk about cutting-edge ML algorithms instead of salt and gluten. Packing and pricing are just more variables for training the next model. Their stock-options are valuable, and their LinkedIn inboxes are full of ML recruiters from Google and Facebook.
And this is why, in turn, calling Google or Facebook or LinkedIn or TikTok 'evil' is unhelpful, not because there's no evil to consider, but because attributing media's socially damaging effects to direct malice is misunderstanding the essential nature of current media technology. People could have wrecked a cookie company by pursuing profits over chewiness, too, but it would have taken cynicism and time. ML can do it without malice, quickly. And unlike cookie baking or hole digging, virtually all current social, media or streaming experiences are driven by machine learning. What ML most enthusiastically facilitates is turning cultural problems into technical problems, reducing the need for qualitative human input, so that they can be addressed by engineers who don't have to know or care about the cultural details. Facebook didn't set out to promote disinformation, and TikTok wasn't specifically meant to primarily boost videos in which it looks like somebody attractive is about to take off their shirt. Instead, engineers set up processes that automatically and opaquely promoted more of whatever produced more time spent, and measured their success by time spent. But circularity is always dangerous, and time spent is a particularly weird metric. Sometimes people spend more time doing activities because those activities are engaging and rewarding.
But sometimes they keep doing them out of addiction, or inertia, or fear. Sometimes they persist for tangible but inconsequential rewards, or in pursuit of withheld gratification, or to justify the sunk cost of frustration, or in ignorance of their alternatives. The time, like the cookies, may suck. And we may have succeeded in building a self-fulfilling machine that teaches itself to suck harder.
This doesn't make machine learning bad, any more than it makes machines bad. But it means that those of us who employ ML algorithms have to accept responsibility for their cultural im-plications, and for the effects of their failures.
And this is where the two types of ML seem to me to materially diverge. My favorite ML failures in music are overwhelmingly of the first type, of training by example. We did a lot of this at the Echo Nest, using human training examples to drive ML processes for scoring songs on psychoacoustic properties like danceability and instrumentalness. Clearly the computers do not dance, and it wasn't our task to make them dance or understand dancing or maximize the time spent dancing. We told them some songs we thought were danceable, and some we thought weren't. Their goal was to find the combinations of measurable qualities that corresponded with these human judgments. P141/142/143
The old algorithm's set had been carefully filtered in many obsessive ways over the years as we learned which kinds of songs work well in algorithmically generated playlists and which don't. Songs with long silent gaps are bad, and we have software for detecting gaps. Commentary tracks detached from the songs they're explaining are bad, and we have software for distinguishing speaking from singing. Kids songs and Christmas songs are bad to mix with non-kids songs or non-Christmas songs, and we have things for those, too. Very long or very short songs are bad.
The new algorithm's set of eligible songs incorporated almost all of those same filters. But not the last one, so its pool of eligible songs was actually larger, and included both longer and shorter ones. It didn't care about the difference, because again, algorithms don't care, but it was trained that success is people playing more songs. If you give people shorter songs, they will play more of them in the same amount of time. This scores better, but isn't a better ex-perience. In fact, a lot of the short songs were objectively bad picks, and the new algorithm had optimized itself to play worse music.
Happily, once we realized this and re-ran the test with the same set of songs eligible for both algorithms, the new one scored about the same as the old one, which is what we expected to begin with.
We didn't get to brag about an improvement, but the engineers got to switch to the new system, and the playlists didn't get worse. The machines didn't learn anything, but we did. P147
Calling code learning, when it doesn't learn, encourages us, as the people both responsible and subject to algorithms, to think and behave as if it does learn. But failures in the applications of algorithms are always a critique of us. We trained them wrong, or we evaluated them wrong, or we optimized them for the wrong goal, or we meant well but we gave them power over us that we should have kept. We cannot, as programmers, program our way out of a lack of self-awareness, any more than as listeners we can consume our way out of being objectified. The algorithms will not adjudicate our human fights, automate our apologies, or optimize us into shared purpose. They will not save us, or save themselves. We have to be willing to say that the best bad answers are still bad, and take a human breath and ask the questions again until the answers are good. P148
We have a big advantage, in music, that the shopping site doesn't have for headphones or julienne blades, which is that people do a lot more listening than they do shopping. We can adjust the effects of our algorithms by changing our thresholds. If we include every listener who has ever heard a single Nightwish song, we get all the serious fans, but also all the people who only ever heard the one random Nightwish song that appeared on a 2018 video-game soundtrack, and the people who don't even usually listen to metal but heard the unrecognizable D] Orkidea trance remix of the instrumental version of Nightwish's 'Bye Bye Beautiful' on a Club Hits compilation. Conversely, if we only include people who have listened to every Nightwish album at least once all the way through, we get a much smaller set of people with a much more intently narrowed field of collective expertise. Too narrow, probably.
Many of those people listen to nothing but Nightwish, which is fine for Nightwish but not so good for knowledge.
In between these extremes, however, we have a lot of flexibility for how we balance coverage and specificity. The more you require a person to have listened to an artist to qualify as a fan, the fewer fans your threshold will produce, and thus the fewer artists will have enough fans for calculating overlap to be meaningful.
But we control that threshold, too, so we could say that only people who have played an artist 100 times in the last month qualify as superfans, but it only takes 10 superfans in common between two artists to make us suspect that they are similar. Or anybody who has played at least three different songs by the artist counts as a casual fan, but it takes 1000 casual fans in common between two artists to suggest similarity. We can do even better by considering that similarity is asym-metric. Nightwish have two million listeners. The Austrian symphonic metal band Visions of Atlantis, who formed in part due to Nightwish's inspiration, have 100,000 listeners. If 20,000 people listen to both bands, that means that 20% of Visions of Atlantis' listenership also listens to Nightwish, which is impressive. But only 1% of Nightwish listeners listen to Visions of Atlantis. P155/156
For Fans Also Like we calibrated the math so that the more popular an artist becomes, the more popular a list of Fans Also Like artists they earn. The talent show contestants get each other, and Rihanna and Ariana both get Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj. Nightwish (2m fans) get Epica (700k fans), Epica get the Dutch band Delain (300k). Visions of Atlantis (100k) get the Swiss band Lunatica (33k). If you wander through these connections you will tend to move gradually down the popularity scale, from the most general collective knowledge towards the more specific, which is a much more rewarding pattern for exploration than all clicks looping grimly back to the same few top stars. p156/157
There are never just three algorithms for anything, though.
Spotify's Discover Weekly is conceptually based on collective knowledge and similarity, but for historical reasons employs a completely different method from Fans Also Like. Instead of being based on overlap between artists' fans, Discover Weekly is based on co-occurrence of songs between listener-made playlists.
And instead of using simple math, like Fans Also Like, it uses a computer-science technique called vector embedding, which turns each thing (in this case a song) into a list of numbers. Vector embeddings are super useful for computing purposes, because they let you measure a distance between things by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between corresponding numbers in the lists for the two things. They're tricky, though, because the dimensions of a song are not clear or obvious in the way that, say, pain medications are measured by dosage and duration. Even a well-defined idea like tempo is a headache to reduce to a single number for a whole song if the song changes speeds. As human listeners, you and I might connect two particular songs because the singers have the same accent, or they both have a particular drum break, but the computers don't know that those elements affect us more than the overall arrangement or the amount of cowbell. Or two songs might be nearly identical in all but one of the dimensions we would think to describe them with, but that one dimension is the language of the lyrics, and thus one is a love song you feel like you could be inside of, and the other one reminds you of waiting for a missing rental car when you were meant to already be at the beach. P157/158
As a teenager in the 80s, I picked bands like choosing gods from a stipulated pantheon, or at best as if the radio let me select any god from any pantheon at all as long as the D'Aulaires wrote a book about it. As an internet kid, they basically pick peers (or nearly) who are just enough more famous than they are for the relationship to be practically asym-metric. Their favorites are thus naturally young, I think not mainly because they're juxtaposing grown-ups and kids and finding the adults intolerable, but because they recognize their imminent future selves so readily in the open sharing of people slightly ahead of them in either age or fame.

### The Revolution of Everyday Life
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 1967
- **Author**: Raoul Vaneigem

The desire to live is a political decision. 'Who wants a world in which the guarantee that we shall not die of starvation entails the risk of dying of boredom?

The man of survival is a man ground up in the machinery of hierarchical power, caught in a net of interferences, a chaos of oppressive techniques whose ordering only awaits patient programming by programmed experts. P18
What am I supposed to do in a group of militants who expect me to leave in the cloakroom - I won't say a few ideas, for my ideas would have led me to join the group - but the dreams and desires which never leave me, the wish to live authentically and without restraint? What's the use of exchanging one isolation, one monotony, one lie for another?
Once the illusion of real change has been exposed, a mere change of illusion becomes intolerable. But present conditions are precisely these: the economy cannot stop making us consume more and more, and to consume without respite is to change illusions at an accelerating pace which gradually dissolves the spaces behind the waterfall of gadgets, family cars and paperback books. P24
People without imagination are beginning to tire of the importance attached to comfort, to culture, to leisure, to all that destroys imagina-tion. This means that people are not really tired of comfort, culture and leisure, but of the use to which they are put, which is precisely what stops us enjoying them. P25
The monotony of the ideological spectacle makes us aware of the passivity of life, of survival. P25
People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints - such people have a corpse in their mouth. P26
In the twentieth century, death terrifies men less than the absence of real life. All these dead, mechanised, specialised actions, stealing a little bit of life a thousand times a day until the mind and body are exhausted, until that death which is not the end of life but the final saturation with absence: this is what lends a dangerous charm to dreams of apocalypses, gigantic destructions, complete annihilations, cruel, clean and total deaths. Auschwitz and Hiroshima are indeed the
'comfort of nihilism'. Let impotence in the face of suffering become a collective feeling, and the demand for suffering and death can sweep a whole community. Consciously or not, most people would rather die than live a permanently unsatisfying life. Look at peace marchers: aside from an active minority of radicals, most of them are nothing but penitents trying to exorcise their desire to disappear with all the rest of humanity. They would deny it, of course, but their miserable faces give them away. The only real joy is revolutionary. P47
Perhaps it is to ensure that a universal desire to perish does not take hold of men that a whole spectacle is organised around particular suffer-ings. A sort of nationalised philanthropy impels each person to find consolation for his own infirmities in the spectacle of other people's.
Consider disaster photographs, stories of cuckolded singers, or the grotesque dramas of the gutter press. And, at the other end of the scale, the hospitals, asylums and prisons - real museums of suffering for the use of those whose fear of going in there makes them rejoice to be on the outside. P47
Every call for productivity under the conditions chosen by capitalist and Soviet economics is a call to slavery. P52
Individualism, alcoholism, collectivism, activism... the variety of ideologies shows that there are a hundred ways of being on the side of Power. There is only one way to be radical. The wall that must be knocked down is immense, but it has been cracked so many times that soon a single cry will be enough to bring it crashing to the ground. Let the formidable reality of the third force emerge at last from the mists of history, with all the individual passions that have fuelled the insurrections of the past! Soon we shall find that an energy is locked up in everyday life which can move mountains and abolish distances. The long revolution is preparing to write works in the ink of action. P62/63
Under the dictatorship of consumer goods, muner melts away like a snowball in hell, its significance passes to aljects wit more representational value, more tangible objects beer adapted to de spectacular ideology of creeping state socialism. Consumer gand encroach on the power of money because, wrapped in ideologs they an the true signs of power. Before long, money's only remaining justific con will be the quantity of objects and useless gadgets it emahes antm acquire and throw away at an ever-accelerating pace, ocly the quiner and the pace matter, because mass distribution automatically wiges qur quality and raricy appeal. Oaly the ability to consume faster and taster-cars, alcohol, houses, TVs and playmates - shows how far you"ve go ug the hierarchical ladder. From blue blood to the power of money, L the superiority of money to the power of the gadget, the nec plans un at Christian/socialist civilisation: a civilisation of prosaisem smd vulgar detail. A perfect nest for Nietzsche's little men'. P72
Purchasing power is a licence to purchase power. The old proletarian sold his labour power in order to subsist; what little leisure time he had was passed pleasantly enough in conversation, arguments, drinking, making love, wandering, celebrating and rioting. The new proletarian sells his labour power in order to consume. When he's not flogging himself to death to get promoted in the labour hierarchy, he's being persuaded to buy himself objects to distinguish himself in the social hier-archy. The ideology of consumption becomes the consumption of ideology. East-West cultural d√©tente is no accident. On the one hand, homo consumator buys a bottle of whiskey and gets as a free gift the lie that accompanies it. On the other hand, communist man buys ideology and gets a bottle of vodka for free. Paradoxically, Soviet and capitalist regimes are taking a common path, the first thanks to an economy of production, the second thanks to an economy of consumption. P72/73
THE REFUSAL OF SACRIFICE is the refusal to be bartered. There is nothing in the world of things, exchangeable for money or not, which can be treated as equivalent to a human being. The individual is irre-ducible. He is subject to change but not to exchange. P112
When people‚Äôs stop being fooled they stop doing what they are told. P121
The passion for play is no longer alienating if the person who gives himself up to it seeks play in the whole of life - in love, in thought, in the construction of situations. In the same way, the wish to kill is no longer megalomania if it is combined with revolutionary consciousness. P121/122
The complete unchaining of pleasure is the surest way to the revolution of everyday life, to the construction of the whole man. P122
When theft needs legal justification, when authority raises the banner of the general interest while pursuing private ends with impunity, is it any wonder that the lie fascinates the minds of men, twisting them to fit its laws until their contortions come to resemble 'natural' human postures? And it is true that man lies because in a world governed by lies he cannot do otherwise: he is falsehood himself, he is trapped in his own false-hood. P123
Eventually the decomposition of the spectacle entails the resort to the spectacle of decomposition. It is in the logic of things that the last actor should film his own death. As it happens, the logic of things is the logic of what can be consumed, and sold as it is consumed. Pataphysics, sub-Dada, and the mise en sc√®ne of impoverished everyday life line the road that leads us with many a twist and turn to the last graveyards. P126
"We would live," says Pascal, "according to the ideas of others; we would live an imaginary life, and to this end we cultivate appearances. Yet in striving to beautify and preserve this imaginary being we neglect everything authentic.‚Äù P132
Only by starving the revolutionary masses of joy can one become their master: uncontained, collective pleasure can only go from victory to victory. P150
Today even the young enjoy the dubious privilege of age. In fact consumer society, which invented- the teenager as a new class of consumer, fosters premature senility: to consume is to be consumed by inauthenticity, nurturing appearance to the advantage of the spectacle and to the detriment of real life. The consumer is killed by the things he becomes attached to, because these things (commodities, roles) are dead. 
Whatever you possess possesses you in return. Everything that makes you into an owner adapts you to the order of things - and makes you old. Time-which-slips-away is what fills the void created by the absence of the self. The harder you run after time, the faster time goes: this is the law of consumption. Try to stop it, and it will wear you out and age you all the more easily. Time has to be caught on the wing, in the present - but the present has yet to be constructed.
We were born never to grow old, never to die. All we can hope for, however, is an awareness of having come too soon. And a healthy contempt for the future can at least ensure us a rich portion of life. P154/155
As we know, the consumption of goods - which comes down always, in the present state of things, to the consumption of power - carries within itself the seeds of its own destruction and the conditions of its own transcendence. The consumer cannot and must not ever attain satisfaction: the logic of the consumable object demands the creation of fresh needs, yet the accumulation of such false needs exacerbates the malaise of men confined with increasing difficulty solely to the status of consumers. Furthermore, the wealth of consumer goods impoverishes authentic life. It does so in two ways. First, it replaces authentic life with things. Secondly, it makes it impossible, with the best will in the world, to become attached to these things, precisely because they have to be consumed, ie, destroyed. Whence an absence of life which is ever more frustrating, a self-devouring dissatisfaction. This need to live is ambiva-lent: it constitutes one of those points where perspective is reversed. P162
Remove the qualitative and all that remains is despair. Despair comes in every variety available to a system designed for killing human beings, the system of hierarchical power: reformism, fascism, philistine apoliti-cism, mediocracy, activism and passivity, boy-scoutism and ideological masturbation. P172
My creativity, no matter how poor, is for me a far better guide than all the knowledge with which my head has been crammed. In the night of Power, its glimmer keeps the enemy forces at bay. These forces are cultural conditioning, specialisation of every kind, and imposed worldviews - all irretrievably totalitarian in nature. In creativity, then, everyone possesses the ultimate weapon. But, like a talisman, this weapon has to be used wittingly. Where creativity is mobilised against the grain, in the service of lies and oppression, it turns into a sick farce: the consecration of art. Furthermore, there is a distinction between acts designed to destroy Power and acts designed to build individual free will: their form is the same but their range is different; as any good strategist knows, you prepare in different ways for defence and attack.
We have not chosen the reversal of perspective out of some kind of voluntarism. It has chosen us. Caught up as we are in the historical state of nothing the next step can only be a change in everything.
Consciousness of total revolution - or rather, of the necessity for it - is the only way we have left of being historical, our last chance to undo history under willed conditions. The game we are about to join is the game of our creativity. Its rules are radically opposed to those which govern our society. P188
The only forms of creativity that authority can deal with, or wishes to deal with, are those which the spectacle can co-opt. But what people do officially is nothing compared with what they do in secret. People usually associate creativity with works of art, but what are works of art alongside the creative energy displayed by everyone a thousand times a day? Alongside seething unsatisfied desires, daydreams in search of a foothold in reality, feelings at once confused and luminously clear, ideas and gestures presaging nameless upheavals?
All this energy, of course, is relegated to anonymity and deprived of adequate means of expression, imprisoned by survival and obliged to find outlets by sacrificing its qualitative richness and conforming to the spectacle's categories. Think of Cheval's palace, the Watts Towers, Fourier's inspired system, or the pictorial universe of Douanier Rousseau. Even more to the point, consider the incredible diversity of anyone's dreams - landscapes the brilliance of whose colours qualitatively surpass the finest canvases of a Van Gogh. Every individual is constantly building an ideal world within himself, even as his external motions bend to the requirements of soulless routine. P191
Spontaneity is the true mode of being of individual creativity, creativity's initial, immaculate form, unpolluted at the source and as yet unthreatened by the mechanisms of co-optation. Whereas creativity in the broad sense is the most equitably distributed thing imag-inable, spontaneity seems to be confined to a chosen few. Its possession is a privilege of those whom long resistance to Power has endowed with a consciousness of their own value as individuals. In revolutionary moments this means the majority; in other periods, when the old mole works unseen, day by day, it is still more people than one might think.
For so long as the light of creativity continues to shine spontaneity has a chance. P194
The traveller who is always thinking about the length of the road before him tires more easily than his companion who lets his imagination wander as he goes along. Similarly, anxious attention paid to lived experience can only impede it, abstract it, and make it into nothing more than a series of memories-to-be. P196
Is not the revolutionary moment a fountain of eternal youth? P229
"All time resides in the moment", according to the Esoteric tradition.
Passed through history's developing tray, a statement in the Pistis Sophia _ "One day of light is a thousand years in the history of the world" - translates word for word into Lenin's assertion that there are days of revolution that are worth centuries. P235
Creativity, love and play are to life what the needs for nourishment and shelter are to survival (1). The project of self-realisation is grounded in the passion to create (2); the project of communication is grounded in the passion of love (4); the project of participation is grounded in the passion for play (6). Wherever these three projects are separated, Power's repressive unity is reinforced. Radical subjectivity is the pressure - discernible in practically everyone at the present time - of an indivisible will to build a passion-filled life (3). The erotic is the spontaneous coherence which gives practical unity to attempts to enrich lived experience. P236
By throwing the whole of everyday life onto 'the battlefield of production and consumption, capitalism crushes the urge to play while at the same time trying to harness it as a source of profit. So, over the last few decades, we have seen the attraction of the unknown turned into mass tourism, adventure turned into scientific expeditions, the great game of war turned into operational strategy, and the taste for change turned into mere changes in taste. P257
The strength of revolutionary armies lies in their creativity.
Frequently, the first days of an insurrection are a walk-over simply because nobody pays the slightest attention to the enemy's rules: because a new game is invented and because everyone takes part in its elabora-tion. But if this creativity flags, if it becomes repetitive, if the revolutionary army becomes a regular army, then blind devotion and hysteria try in vain to make up for military weakness. Infatuation with past victories breeds terrible defeats. P261
In short, subversion is the basic expression of creativity. Daydreaming subverts the world. Sometimes subversion is like Monsieur Jourdain speaking prose; sometimes it is more like James Joyce writing Ulysses. P264


### Filterworld
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 2024
- **Author**: Kyle Chayka

In place of the human gatekeepers and curators of culture, the editors and DJs, we now have a set of algorithmic gatekeepers. While this shift has lowered many cultural barriers to entry, since anyone can make their work public online, it has also resulted in a kind of tyranny of real-time data. Attention becomes the only metric by which culture is judged, and what gets attention is dictated by equations developed by Silicon Valley engineers. The outcome of such algorithmic gatekeeping is the pervasive flattening that has been happening across culture. By flatness I mean homogenization but also a reduction into simplicity; the least ambiguous, least disruptive, and perhaps least meaningful pieces of culture are promoted the most.
Flatness is the lowest common denominator, an averageness that has never been the marker of humanity's proudest cultural creations. P9
Algorithms are digital machines that turn a series of inputs into a particular output, like a conveyor belt in a factory. What makes one algorithm different from another is less their structure than the ingredients they are built from. All recommendation algorithms work by gathering a set of raw data. The overall term for that dataset is signal, the collected inputs that are fed into the machine. The signal data might include a user's past purchases on Amazon or how many other users favorited a particular song on Spotify. The data is quantitative rather than qualitative, since it must be able to be processed by the machine. So even if the data is about something as subjective as music preferences, it is translated into numbers: x number of users rated y band an average of z, or x number of users listened to y band z times. The primary signal fed into many social media recommendations is engagement, which describes how users are interacting with a piece of content. That might come in the form of likes, retweets, or plays‚Äî any kind of button found next to a post. High engagement means the number of likes, views, or shares is higher than the average of other posts. P19
An executive at the music cataloging and recommendation service Pandora once described the company's system to me as an
"orchestra" of algorithms, complete with a "conductor" algorithm.
Each algorithm used different strategies to come up with a recom-mendation, and then the conductor algorithm dictated which suggestions were used at a given moment. (The only output was the next song to play in a playlist.) Different moments called for different algorithmic recommendation techniques. P20
"The volume of things is considerably more than any person can possibly filter through in order to find the ones that he or she will like." Automated filters would be necessary, they concluded: "We need technology to help us wade through all the information to find the items we really want and need, and to rid us of the things we do not want to be bothered with." (Of course, this is still a huge problem online.) Shardanand and Maes argued that content-based filtering had significant drawbacks. It requires the material to be translated into data that the machine can understand, such as text; it lacks serendipity because it can filter only by the terms that the user inputs; and it does not measure inherent quality. It is unable to "distinguish a well written (and] a badly written article if the two articles use the same terms." The inability to evaluate quality brings to mind artificial intelligence: New tools like ChatGPT seem to be able to understand and generate meaningful language, but really, they only repeat patterns inherent in the preexisting data they are trained on. Quality is subjective; data alone, in the absence of human judgment, can go only so far in gauging it. P23
Facebook's Like button, with its signature thumbs-up, was introduced in 2009, providing one form of data on how interested a user might be in a particular piece of content. User engagement, measured by likes, comments, and one account's previous interactions with another, factored into the order of the feed. That algorithmic system was called EdgeRank, and Facebook identified its principal variables as affinity score, edge weight, and time decay. "Edge" referred to any action people carry out on Facebook, which is then sent to the News Feed as an update to be listed. Affinity score represented how connected a user was to the poster and the strength of the connection (eg., consistently commenting on friend's posts). A comment counted more than a like, and recent interactions counted more than older ones. Edge weight evaluated different categories of interactions: an update of a friend posting a new photo might be given more weight by the algorithm than posting a link to a news article or joining a new group. Time decay was the age of the action; recent actions were more likely to be at the top of the News Feed than older ones, if the other factors were equal. The EdgeRank scores were not permanently assigned once, like the outcome of a basketball game in a tournament, but changed instant to instant.
And those three categories aren't simply single, neutral data points; they are collections of data packaged and interpreted in specific ways by Facebook. P30
The algorithmic feed itself is not consistent or on a linear path toward some ultimate perfection. It changes with a company's priorities. P30
The advent of Filterworld has seen a breakdown in monoculture. It has some advantages‚Äî more than ever before, we can all consume a wider possible range of media-but it also has negative consequences. Culture is meant to be communal and requires a certain degree of consistency across audiences; without communality, it loses some of its essential impact. P33
a fundamental rule of Filterworld:
Under algorithmic feeds, the popular becomes more popular, and the obscure becomes even less visible. Success or failure is acceler-ated. "A traditional Instagram post, the life of it is dictated by the first three to five minutes. P37
In 2018, Shagun Jhaver, at the time a PhD candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, worked with two Airbnb employees to conduct a sociological study of the company's users. They analyzed how the platform's hosts‚Äî who rented out their homes on the service for income interacted with and felt about Airbnb's algorithmic recommendation, search, and ratings systems, which helped renters find and book their listings. Jhaver and the other researchers coined the term algorithmic anxiety for the hosts' "uncertainty about how Airbnb algorithms work and a perceived lack of control," the team wrote in their findings. Hosts worried that the search algorithm was unfairly ignoring them or prioritizing other properties. Jhaver noticed that the anxiety was ascribed more to the technology than the quality of the actual homes the hosts were renting out: "It was particularly to do with the algorithm itself rather than improving their listing and property in other ways," he told me. P38
"At the end of the day, even the people who create the algorithms cannot tell you which factor was responsible for which decision; the complexity of the algorithm is so high that disentangling different factors is just not possible.‚Äù P39
Algorithmic anxiety happens because there is a dramatically asymmetrical relationship between user and algorithm. For the individual user, trying to predict or dictate the outcome of the algorithm is like trying to control the tide. To continue the metaphor, all users can do is surf the wave that's already formed. There is little incentive for companies to assuage this anxiety because a user's confusion can be beneficial to business. When a company's product is ineffective or a user encounters difficulty, it can be blamed on the opaque entity of "the algorithm," which is perceived as external to both the users and the company itself, since they are likened to opaque "black boxes." Exploitation is disguised as an accidental glitch instead of an intentional corporate policy. In reality, a company like Facebook is wholly in control of their algorithmic systems, able to change them at will‚Äîor turn them off.
Algorithmic anxiety places the burden of action on the individ-ual, not the business‚Äî the user must change their behavior or risk disappearing. Users sometimes complain of being "shadowbanned" when their posts or content on a platform suddenly lack the same level of engagement as before. Users often fear that their account specifically has been blocked without warning or recourse by some decision-maker; but the algorithmic priorities may simply have silently changed, and traffic is no longer flowing in their direction. The effect goes back to the Mechanical Turk; we can't always tell the difference between technology working and the illusion of technology working, but the perception may be just as impactful, in the end, as the reality. P40/41
The consequences of such anxiety include "algorithmic determinism, fatalism, cyni-cism, and nihilism," de Vries wrote. It builds to a sense that, since we users cannot control the technology, we may as well succumb to the limits of algorithmic culture and view it as inevitable. Many users have already entered such a state of despair, both dissatisfied and unable to imagine an alternative. P41
The brand a customer picks says as much about them as it does about the brand it's a reciprocal relationship between creator and customer, with the customer believing (or hoping) that the brand's ethos is representative of their own identity.
A shopper doesn't go to Nike just because they want good running shoes; Nike casts an aura of youth and energy over everything it pro-duces, whether sneakers or brightly screen-printed T-shirts. Zara makes dresses, among many other clothing items, and through them projects a sense of cutting-edge style without the cost of traditional luxury brands. To buy a Zara dress is to participate in its image of efficient glamour‚Äîa nightly party. Every piece in the store refers to that sensibility. In other words, each store serves a particular sensibility, and consumers select from them based on their individual tastes. P43
A joke written on Twitter by a Google engineer named Chet Haase in 2017 pinpoints the problem: "A machine learning algorithm walks into a bar. The bartender asks, 'What'll you have?' The algorithm says, 'What's everyone else having?'" The punch line is that in algorithmic culture, the right choice is always what the majority of other people have already chosen. But even if everyone else was, maybe you're just not in the mood for a whiskey sour. P46
Taste is a word for how we measure culture and judge our relationship to it. If something suits our taste, we feel close to it and identify with it, as well as form relationships with other people based on it, the way customers commune over clothing labels (either loving or hating a particular brand). Intentionally bad taste might be just as compelling as good taste, as the author Rax King described in her book Tacky: "Tackiness is joyfulness." But in its origins, taste is a much deeper philosophical concept. It borders on morality, representing an innate sense of what is good in the world. P48
"In order to have taste, it is not enough to see and to know what is beautiful in a given work. One must feel beauty and be moved by it. It is not even enough to feel, to be moved in a vague way: it is essential to discern the different shades of feeling." Taste goes beyond superficial observation, beyond identifying something as "cool." Taste requires experiencing the creation in its entirety and evaluating one's own authentic emotional response to it, parsing its effect. (Taste is not passive; it requires effort.) P48
When recommendation algorithms are based only on data about what you and other platform users already like, then these algorithms are less capable of providing the kind of surprise that might not be immediately pleasurable, that Montesquieu described. The feed structure also discourages users from spending too much time with any one piece of content. If you find something boring, perhaps too subtle, you just keep scrolling, and there's no time for a greater sense of admiration to develop-one is increasingly encouraged to lean into impatience and superficiality in all things. P51
Building your own sense of taste, that set of subconscious principles by which you identify what you like, is an uphill battle compared to passively consuming whatever content feeds deliver to you. But the situation can't solely be blamed on the presence of algorithms. Today we have more cultural options available to us than ever and they are accessible on demand. We are free to choose anything. Yet the choice we often make is to not have a choice, to have our purview shaped by automated feeds, which may be based on the aggregate actions of humans but are not human in themselves. P51
I find myself mortified when I pick out a previously unexplored bar or restaurant for a group of friends, a choice I think will be a crowd-pleaser, and it turns out to have entirely the wrong vibe. (One such bar in D.C. turned out to have too many taxidermy animal heads on the walls for com-fort.) In that situation, an automated recommendation from Yelp or Google Maps may have suited me better: the proof of demo-cratic, average approval takes the pressure off making a choice that may prove too quirky. Yet at the same time, I wouldn't want those lowest-common-denominator rules to determine which books I read or television shows I watch. Culture isn't a toaster that you can rate out of five stars‚Äî-though the website Goodreads, now owned by Amazon, tries to apply those ratings to books. There are plenty of experiences I love‚Äî a plotless novel like Rachel Cusk's Outline, for example-that others would doubtless give a bad grade. But those are the rules that Filterworld enforces for everything. P52
There are two forces forming our tastes. As I described previ-ously, the first is our independent pursuit of what we individually enjoy, while the second is our awareness of what it appears that most other people like, the dominant mainstream. The two may move in opposite directions, but it's often easier to follow the latter, particularly when the Internet makes what other people are consuming so immediately public. (If you didn't post about it, did you really watch a TV show?) Algorithmic feeds further reinforce the presence of that mainstream, against which our personal choices are evaluated. Taste is inescapable; it involves "the most everyday choices of everyday life, e.g, in cooking, clothing, or decoration," the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu wrote in his 1984 book Distinc-tion: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste. These choices can be symbolic of a range of things beyond just our aesthetic preferences, such as economic class, political ideology, and social identity. "Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier," Bourdieu wrote. No wonder that we worry about what to like, and sometimes find it simpler to export that responsibility to machines. P53
Should the human fashion editor tell you what to like or should it be the algorithmic machine, in the form of the Amazon bookstore, Spotify feed, or Netflix home page? That is the central dilemma of culture in Filterworld. The former option is mercurial and driven by elite gatekeepers, a powerful group built up over a century of modern cultural industries, riddled with their own blind spots and biases including those of gender and race. (That group includes not just the mostly white fashion magazine editors of New York City but also Hollywood producers, record-label executives, and museum curators.) Yet the human flaws may become even more dramatic in an algorithmic ecosystem when the actions of mass audiences dictate what can easily be seen. Racism, sexism, and other forms of bias are a de facto part of that equation.
Online, users are often insulated from views and cultures that clash with their own. The overall digital environment is dictated by tech companies with ruthlessly capitalist, expansionary motives, which do not provide the most fertile ground for culture. While the magazine fashion editor may periodically use their ability to pick out and promote a previously unheard voice, the algorithmic feed never will; it can only iterate on established engagement. We users have less chance of encountering a shockingly new thing and deciding for ourselves if we like it. Fashion, to take one example, is often strongest as an art form when it doesn't follow the rules and chase averages. Part of its appeal lies in breaking with the social code: wearing something unexpected or strange, even at times challenging your own taste. It's something that no automated recommendation alone can approximate. Algorithmic feeds are a double-edged sword:
A marginalized fashion designer might find a way to game the Instagram algorithm and spark their own popularity without waiting to be noticed by a white editor who might be biased against them.
But they are then conforming to the tenets of a tech company even more powerful and more blinkered than the editor. P55/56
The only thing that had changed to possibly cause the "Strange" phenomenon was that in 2017, Spotify had made its autoplay option the default. So anytime the music that the user had chosen stopped-whether a track, album, or playlist-another algorithmically recommended song would instantly play.
"On the day that they switched the preset, it was the beginning of this separation of one song from the rest of our catalog," Krukowski said: "Strange" was being recommended by that system more often than any of Galaxie 500's other songs. Krukowski posted his observations in a newsletter, which attracted the attention of Glenn McDonald, who at the time worked as Spotify's "data alche-mist." McDonald did an internal investigation and concluded that "Strange" had hit the algorithmic jackpot not because of Galaxie 500's unique musical style, but because the song was more similar to songs by other bands than Galaxie 500's other tracks. In many cases, if "Strange" played, the listener was unlikely to hit the Skip or Stop button, and so the recommender system registered it as an effective selection and offered it to ever more listeners. P60/61
This is how algorithmic normalization happens. Normal is a word for the unobtrusive and average, whatever won't provoke negative reactions. Whichever content fits in that zone of averageness sees accelerated promotion and growth, like "Strange" did, while the rest falls by the wayside. As fewer people see the content that doesn't get promoted, there is less awareness of it and less incentive for creators to produce it‚Äîin part because it wouldn't be financially sustainable. (The rule of culture in Filterworld is: Go viral or die.) P61
As Pajkovic wrote, "Feedback loops reinforce a user's preexisting preferences, diminishing their exposure to a diverse range of cultural offerings and denying art, aesthetics and culture of its confrontational societal role." That lack of confrontation is concern-ing. It's not that great art needs to be inherently offensive; rather, when everything conforms to established expectations, we miss out on culture that is truly progressive and uncomfortable, that might subvert categories rather than fit neatly into them. P70
Algorithmic culture congregates in the center, because the decision to consume a piece of culture is rarely motivated by hate or conflict. Jingjing Zhang, a professor at Indiana University who studies recommendation algo-rithms, found evidence for the theory of homogenization when she collaborated on an experiment about personalized music recom-mendations, presented at the 2012 Dublin Conference on Recommender Systems.
Students were presented with songs that they were told had been recommended to them based on their personal taste, as indicated by a star rating but the ratings were actually artificial and arbi-trary. Students were then asked how much they would pay for a given song; the higher the star rating, the more they were willing to pay. Each added star resulted in a 10 to 15 percent increase in willingness to pay for the song. The experiment showed how the perception of recommendation could skew the perceived value of a given piece of culture, making it seem more likable or significant.
The flaw intensifies due to the self-reinforcing loop of algorithmic recommendations. Over time, the system will "provide less diverse recommendations," as Zhang told the podcast Planet Money. Even-tually, she said, it will "provide similar items to everybody, like, regardless of personal taste." Hence the homogenization we are experiencing today. P72
Benjamin's library was a personal monument, the same kind that we all construct of things we like or identify with, building our sense of taste. Its importance lay in its permanence collections are made up of things that we own, that don't go away unless we decide they should. "Ownership is the most intimate relationship that one can have to objects,
" Benjamin wrote. "Not that they have come alive in
him; it is he who lives in them." In other words, we often discover, and even rediscover, ourselves in what we keep around us. But that codependence or co-evolution of collection and person wouldn't happen if the order of Benjamin's shelves and the catalog of his books kept changing every few months. That's what Spotify's interface updates and algorithmic changes felt like to me: a total disruption of the pieces of art and culture that shaped me. P75
In Filterworld, culture is becoming more ambient. Like Sleepify, it's designed to be ignored, or, like the Marvel movie franchise, no single moment or fragment of it is particularly significant because there is always more to be consumed. When we embrace ambience, we lose the meaning of the finite and the discrete. P85
In the place of physical hotels and airports, we have Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok as spaces of congregation that erase differences. Moving past Koolhaas's "Generic City," there is now also the generic global consumer, whose preferences and desires are molded more by the platforms they use than where they live. In some cases, we conduct our lives more in the space of flows than the space of places. P104
Simply existing as a coffee shop isn't enough; the business has to cultivate a parallel existence on the Internet, which is a separate skill set entirely. "It almost feels like, you must have a social media acu-men, you must be savvy in this area that is adjacent to your business, but not directly embedded in your business, in order to be successful and visible," Walsh continued. That means achieving metrics like plenty of tagged photos on Instagram and positive user reviews on the business's listing on Google Maps. The end point of this pressure to have a digital presence was a form of restaurant that only existed online. P110
Ungureanu developed an Instagram account full of cappuccino snapshots and accrued over seven thousand followers but grew frustrated when she felt that the platform was taking away her ability to access her audience through the feed. When her caf√© started selling coffee online, Facebook and Instagram seemed to throttle their reach-unless they bought ads and boosted the social media company's own profits. It felt like algorithmic blackmail: pay our toll or we won't promote you. The tools that had served the cafe to grow and access new customers were suddenly being turned against it.
Facebook and Instagram "don't let you take advantage of the community you've already built. From a certain moment onward, things are unfair," Ungureanu said. P111
Pursuing Instagrammability is a trap: the fast growth that comes with adopting a recognizable template, whether for a physical space or purely digital content, gives way to the daily grind of keeping up posts and figuring out the latest twists of the algorithm-which hashtags, memes, or formats need to be followed. Digital platforms take away agency from the business owners, pressuring them to follow in lockstep rather than pursue their own creative whims. There's a risk as well in hewing too closely to trends. Clich√© is not desirable.
If a trope is too stale, the algorithmic audiences won't engage with it, either. That's why the perfect generic coffee shop design keeps changing slightly, adding more potted plants or taking a few away. In the algorithmic feed, timing is everything. P112
The other strategy is to remain consistent, not worrying about trends or engagement and simply sticking to what you know best‚Äî staying authentic to a personal ethos or brand identity in the deepest sense. P112
attention-tend to speak louder than the piece of culture itself. Not only do they act as a measure of success, but they create success, because they dictate what is recommended to and seen by audiences in the first place. P132
Suddenly, users could tell how every little piece of content compared to every other one. The numbers could not be escaped, popping up next to everything you read or watched. Even if the count of likes, shares, retweets, or faves was an artificial measure of value imposed by the platform itself, they still became the fastest and easiest way to judge what popped up in the infinite feeds of content. More was always better: if a YouTube video had a lot of views, perhaps it might be insightful or at least funny. Virality equaled quality-other people liked this, so you will, too. For cre-ators, whether writers or aspiring Instagram influencers, metrics were the goal, the incentive, and the internal compass evaluating what worked and what didn't. Particularly in journalism, the higher the numbers, the more important something seemed to be. It was a truism: more likes meant more people had seen something. Each like was a vote in the seemingly meritocratic Internet, where anyone could upload content but certainly not everyone could inspire audiences to pay attention. P133
This is not a new pressure; it's basic human psychology to want to be liked, and we ultimately like what is most similar to us, the same way that mirroring another person's body language in conversation can make you appear more convincing or empathetic. Likability binds society together with the shared incentive to not offend or alienate. Yet interpersonal likability has not been a common metric of culture, particularly the kind of innovative art we have prized over the past century or two. Art itself-not to mention artists as people‚Äî tends not to be bound by the quest for likability, and yet likes are what the current tyranny of quantification prioritizes most. In Filterworld, what is likable succeeds and what is not likable is doomed to fail, particularly in any arena of culture where audiences are requisite for survival. And because our American cultural landscape is almost entirely subservient to capitalism, that means more or less all of it. P138/139
"These streaming services have been making something they call 'movies' They ain't movies. They are some weird algorithmic processes that has created things that last 100 minutes or so." "Much of culture now has the hollow, vacant feeling of having been made by algorithm," wrote the critic Dean Kissick, one of the more incisive commentators on contemporary culture, in 2021. "Algorithmic" has become a byword for anything that feels too slick, too reductive, or too optimized for attracting attention: a combination of high production values with little concern for fundamental content. P140
 
All culture is now content, and the platforms we use to access it encourage us to treat it as interchangeable. P144
Everything exists within the algorithmic context of passive, frictionless consumption. No matter that a book or other piece of content seems to exist outside of the algorithmic ecosys-tem; it is still informed by the dominant aesthetics and trends that algorithmic feeds have given rise to. The end point of algorithmic culture is a constant flow of similar-yet-different content, varied enough so as not to be utterly boring but never disruptive enough to be alienating. Reaching toward an ambitious artistic ideal may have faded in favor of refinement toward the goal of likes and engagement above all. P148/149
The cultural ecosystem of Filterworld puts the cart before the horse: The needs of promotion and marketing supersede the object that is meant to be promoted. Not only does culture have to be designed to generate external content to serve as marketing on digital platforms; the platforms also profit from the increased engagement driven by new content. It can be seen as either a symbiotic relationship or a vicious cycle, reinforcing the need to cater to the aesthetic requirements of the platform. Optimizing for this equation-second-guessing a creative process in advance is much easier than finding an alternative to it. At this point, many pieces of contemporary culture have come to resemble or glorify the social platforms themselves‚Äîall the better to be distributed through them. P151
After all, if the bulk of culture now takes place on social media, what more powerful role could there be than controlling the flow of attention and being able to direct an audience in particular ways?
(Influencers are the cowboys of algorithms.)
The superficiality of the word itself is indicative: "influence" is never the end point, only a means of communicating a particular message. An influencer is easiest to define by how they make money.
Like a media company producing magazines or podcasts, they sell advertising shown to the audiences that they have gathered. But the content that draws the audiences in in the first place is most often the influencer's personal life, their aesthetically appealing surroundings (as well as aesthetically appealing selves) and entertaining activities. The material of their lives‚Äî in varying degrees of organic and staged-is copiously documented on social media platforms like Instagram, where they also publish sponsored posts for brands.
Another difference is that unlike a free newspaper distributed on the street or a radio station sending out a signal, influencers don't own the infrastructure of their medium. They piggyback on the digital platforms' ability to distribute content, both through widely installed smartphone apps and through in-app feeds. P154
2016, when its feed changed from chronological to algorithmic.
"For me, personally, in the way that I grew through social media, the change of the platform to give power to the algorithm was worst possible thing," he told me. Originally, he could post several times a day and know that his posts would reach his followers in real time, in a chronological order that made sense for his storytelling. Now he can't tell when or in what order his images will show up. It's frustrating on the consumption side as well as creation: "No one is really given that choice to make that decision for themselves, to curate what they're seeing in a way that feels great to them. It's all being dictated by the algorithm." P160
This need to corral an audience in advance by succeeding on social media can be explained by the useful phrase "content capital."
Established by the scholar Kate Eichhorn in her 2022 monograph Content, it describes the Internet-era state in which "one's ability to engage in work as an artist or a writer is increasingly contingent on one's content capital; that is, on one's ability to produce content not about one's work but about one's status as an artist, writer, or per-former." In other words, the emphasis is not on the thing itself bur the aura that surrounds it, the ancillary material that one produces because of living the lifestyle of a creator. That ancillary content might be Instagram selfies, photos of a painting studio, evidence of travel, tossed-off observations on Twitter, or a monologue on Tik Tok It all builds an audience for the person, who remains a separate entity from the things that they make. If Roland Barthes's 1967 essay predicted "the death of the author," the author's personal brand is now all that matters; it's the work itself that is dead. P164
Eichhorn responds to the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's 1970s concept of "cultural capital": the fluency in forms of high culture that could bestow social status and help members of elite classes to identify one another. Cultural capital is knowing that cashmere is a more aspirational fabric than cotton or that a Jackson Pollock painting is much more than a mess of drips that a child could rep-licate. (Bourdieu points out that, in the West, being open to radical aesthetic experimentation and abstraction are markers of the elite class.) Not only is it an understanding of art; it is an understanding of what art means in a social context, and what different pieces or artists symbolize. Content capital, then, is fluency in digital content: the knowledge of what kinds of content to produce, how the feeds of various platforms work, what they prioritize, and how audiences might react to a given creation. Those who have more content capital gain more followers, and thus more power in the cultural ecosystem of Filterworld. P165
That is not to say that content begets art. In fact, the excess content demanded by algorithmic feeds more often gets in the way of art, because it sucks up an increasingly high percentage of a creator's time. "Cultural producers who, in the past, may have focused on writing books or producing films or making art must now also spend considerable time producing (or paying someone else to produce) content about themselves and their work," Bich-hom wrote. As anyone who has tried to get an undertaking off the groand online-a bake sale, a party, an art installation-knows, ancillary content quickly becomes a distraction. The author (me) is too busy instagramming his artfully cluttered desk, broadcasting his writerly identity, and checking for subsequent likes to actually write his book. P166
The instantaneous wave of likes in response to a post helps the recommendation algorithm evaluate which pieces of content should be promoted, but it also gives the creator an unprecedented realtime measure of what resonates with their audiences, as if every thought was gauged by a Nielsen rating viewable on a smartphone.
Cultural flattening is one consequence. But the same mechanism is also what makes our public political discourse more and more extreme, because conflict and controversy light up the feed and attract likes in a way that subtlety and ambiguity never will. P168
Knowing how and why something has been recommended might help to dispel the air of algorithmic anxiety that surrounds our online experiences, since we could identify which of our actions the recommendations are considering. Still, it leaves users responsible for themselves: Knowing how the algorithm works isn't the same as being able to control it. "Transparency alone cannot create accountable systems," Ananny and Crawford wrote. P197
"We click with our monkey brains, the same ones that cause us to buy a candy bar in the checkout line at the grocery store." Algorithmic feeds accelerate these worst impulses, not just on an individual level but an aggregate one, across all the users of a social network. Titillating material-content that might be violent, pro-vocative, or misleading‚Äî can be easier to discover than material that is more boring but also more valuable. P210
While previous generations might have had dance halls or independent radio stations to help them discover new music during their formative teenage years, and young people in the twenty-first century have Til Tok feeds and Spotify playlists, millennials in the late 1990s and early 2000s had online forums and MP3 piracy. These required much more labor to find what you like and consume it than the frictionless avenues of algorithmic feeds. While avoiding that labor may be convenient, it also makes our personal tastes flimsier, less hard-won. P231
Those forums were "communities of con-sumption," a term that academics have used to describe the diverse groups of people that congregate online around a particular shared pursuit, whether swapping product tips or discussing avant-garde literature. One paper described communities of consumption as a form of "mutual learning" ‚Äî we collectively figure out what it is that we're looking for and how to find it. The likes of Twitter and Facebook with their unstable interfaces and manipulative algorithms, are less conducive to mutual learning. P232/233
A lot of human effort is required to create something original, no matter the intended outcome. As my art-critic friend Orit Gat once told me, partly joking but also serious, you should look at a painting for as long as it took the artist to paint it. Flipping through so much incoherently assembled content in our feeds, we don't have the opportunity to assimilate it, to learn and understand, much less pass on that understanding to others. That encouraged shallowness of consumption contributes to the overall flatness of culture in Filterworld. P234


### For The Culture

Culture side-steps conventional value propositions, functional or category benefits, and mind-share marketing. It moves beyond a brand having the sharpest razor, the fastest car, or the longest-lasting battery. Culture supersedes all these product differentiators because it does not revolve around what the product is. Culture focuses on who we are.
Culture: as a system of symbols, beliefs, and values used by groups of people to establish norms and roles. Durkheim underscored the complexity of culture, as a "system" that defines a group of people, while also providing some elemental codes that collectively make up the system-shared beliefs (values and principles, a way of thinking), rituals (traditions, social norms), artifacts (symbols, clothes, decora-tions, tools), and, of course, language (dialect, lexicon, songs, poetry).
Durkheim called these elemental codes "social facts," a manner of thinking, feeling, and acting that is constructed by society at large. In this way, social facts are the collective representation of social behavior for a distinct group of people.
Williams defined culture as a realized signifying system, a system through which we interpret the world and make sense of it. This system, as Williams argued, is a whole way of life for people--a program for everyday living. It is through this system that we translate our daily experiences to inform how we respond to them because of what they mean. Culture is a realized meaning-making system. More accurately, it is a system of systems--a set of interdependent principles and mechanisms that all inform each other--which, collectively, influences practically everything that we do because of who we are and how we see the world.

Therefore, our cultural affiliation is anchored by how we self-identify-the categorical labels we use to tell people who we are and to associate with other people based on who they are. These labels range from geographical in nature (like where you're from) to institutions (the college you attended), activities (sports), consumption behavior (anime enthusiasts), and a host of seemingly endless designations that make up our identity. Identity is the cornerstone of culture.
On its surface, the concept of a shared belief is fairly straightfor-ward. It is the collective acceptance of a truth, the communal view of reality. Is there a God? Are there other life forms throughout the gal-axies? Was the moon landing a hoax? Should there be a separation of church and state? Are all men created equal? Is there no place for politics in sports? These held beliefs help us frame the endless amount of information that is transmitted from our senses to our brains so that we can make meaning of the world and know how to operate in it. Ana√Øs Nin is famously quoted as saying, "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." That is, the truth is not as objective as we would like to believe. The truth is culturally mediated and socially negotiated and constructed based on our communal view of reality-our beliefs.

Shared beliefs and ideologies are the least tangible system of culture but arguably the most important because this system precedes all others. It's because we hold certain beliefs deeply and emotionally-that we commit to certain behaviors, not the other way around. Although our beliefs and ideologies are not easily seen, they are reflected in everything we do. The anthropologist and culture scholar Grant McCracken wrote about how our everyday experiences are culturally constituted, shaped, and mediated by our beliefs and assumptions of right and wrong, just and unfair, acceptable and undesirable. It's our system of shared beliefs and ideologies that dictates what seems
"normal" and what seems "out of place" and therefore, it's this system that determines what gets adopted and what does not.
Audiences buy products because of their function. Congregations buy products as evidence of their beliefs.
Take generationalism, for instance- mil-lennials, gen Z, etc. These, too, are constructs that don't actually describe real people. These generational titles are arbitrarily assigned to a group of people based on their date of birth-a demographic. And we have a mental picture of who these people are. But there are eighty million millennials in the United States. How can we say that they are all the same just because they were born in a certain time span? People aren't governed by their demography; they are governed by their cultural sub-scriptions, which are reflected in their tribal memberships. This is about disposition, not demography. No wonder so many people don't take action when marketers try to get them to move. The marketers are targeting labels, not real people.
But tribes are real, and their members act together to promote social solidarity among themselves, which is superpowerful for anyone who aims to excite people to take action. 
Culture is a realized meaning-making system. It is anchored in our identity and shaped by our worldview, which subsequently influences what we do and how we consume.
to sell a brand, promote a candidate, or inspire people to join a cause, you must first look inward and ask yourself, "What does my brand be-lieve?" "How does my candidate see the world?" "What's the ideology of our cause?" This is where we want to start-identifying the brand's beliefs.
The brand belief should be the articulation of something substantive as opposed to vain platitudes and empty statements like, "We believe in integrity. While that may indeed be true, what you want to unearth is
"why does integrity matter to the brand?" What is the conviction that drives you and your company to have integrity? As we saw earlier in the chapter, Patagonia believes in "climbing clean" and that informs everything the brand does-from the products it makes to how it communicates its products. Patagonia's conviction to "climbing clean" is so strong that instead of taking the $3 billion company public or selling it off to the highest bidder, Yvon Chouinard and his family recently decided to give it away. In a September 2022 statement, Chouinard announced that he and his family were transferring ownership of the company to a trust and a nonprofit organization that will fund people who are actively working to save the planet. Now, that's conviction!
Identifying the belief system in this way is critical because it's your belief system that will inform whom you'll target-the people who are most likely to move because they share the same worldview. If your brand believes that life is an adventure and should be lived as such, then you can imagine the kinds of people you'd target: adventure seek-ers, X-Gamers, or adrenaline junkies. These are the people who see the world similarly to the brand, and they'll be more inclined to consume than most people would be, not (just) because of what the product is but also because of who these people are. As you identify your brand's belief, make a list of all the different communities that probably share the same belief system. Resist the urge to rely on demographics. In-stead, think about real collectives that already exist. Together, these networked tribes will make up your congregation. And once you've found your congregation, it's time to preach the gospel.
Instead of communicating its inventory selection and great customer service, REI decided to communicate its belief to the people who shared its worldview, and this activated people to move- to go outdoors and consume. Simply put, REI found its congregation- the collection of networked tribes who subscribe to the same beliefs and ideology as the brand-and preached the gospel to them, which inspired collective behavior.
the reptilian brain is the oldest part of the brain. It is associated with primitive bodily functions that we take for granted, like controlling our heart rate, breathing, and blinking. This brain system is also associated with the "fight or flight" response, which is involuntary because we're wired for it.
The second system of the brain is the limbic system. This part of the brain is associated with emotions like love, trust, and connection.
Within the limbic system live complex structures like the hippocam-pus--a structure that plays a major role in learning and the formation of memories--and the amygdala- a structure responsible for the emotional salience of our memories. These two structures work together in the limbic system to associate memories with emotions so that we know how to respond to stimuli in the world. It's no surprise that the amygdala is also connected to our "fight or flight" response based on the emotional experiences that have been logged into our long-term memory. As Jon T. Willie, a neurosurgeon and director of the laboratory for behavioral neuromodulation at Emory University in Atlanta, put it, "If you have an emotional experience, the amygdala seems to tag that memory in such a way so that it is better remembered" Ihis is likely why emotions flood our brains with rich memories when we hear a song that takes us back to a certain place and time when that song was prevalent in our lives. We become overwhelmed with the feelings associated with that emotional tag, which compels us to relive that experience or repel it. That's the limbic system at work.
Not only is the limbic system associated with emotions, but it is also a part of how we make decisions. That is to say, the part of the brain responsible for our feelings is also associated with how we decide what to do. We know this intuitively, but we call it "gut instinct." We feel it in our gut, and then we act accordingly. However, that association has nothing to do with our stomachs and everything to do with the activity that goes on in our limbic system. When it comes to "gut instinct" it's often difficult to put a finger on why we feel the way we do. It just feels like the right thing to do, so we do it; or it feels wrong, and we don't. What's worse is that we typically can't explain it, either. The rationale for these "gut instinct" decisions is hard to put into words. If someone asked me how I knew my wife was the woman I wanted to marry, I wouldn't have a clear answer. I just knew it. I can't put into words why, nor can I identify the exact moment that I knew. I felt it in my gut--the limbic system-and I went for it. This separation between articulation and "gut instinct" is also a factor of biology because language is not associated with the limbic system but rather it is a function of the third system of the brain, the neocortex.
The neocortex is the part of the brain where higher-order cognitive functions, like abstract thought, language, and rationality; are performed. Between the limbic system and the neocortex, we have one system that is associated with emotions and behavior--the lim-bic system-and another associated with language and rationality. 
We're not rational human beings; we're rationalizing human beings. We make most of our decisions based on shortcut heuristics that are informed by the emo-fional tags we place on our memory associations, which informs how we feel-and, ultimately, what we do.
The truth of the matter is that we know what decisions we're going to make before we make them based on how we feel. After that, we cherry-pick the data to support our feelings. In psychology, this is called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, a cognitive bias in which we ignore the information that differs from our perspective and choose the data that supports it. This bias is based on the metaphor of a gunman who shoots at a wall and then draws the target around the bullet holes afterward--as is the case of our "rationality, or lack thereof. Our behaviors are biologically connected to our feelings--our limbic sys-tem. So if we want to get people to move, our best chance to do so is to appeal to the limbic system by activating the emotional side of the brain that informs behavior.
But how do we appeal to the limbic system? How do leaders pull at the emotional cords of the brain that catalyze behavior? How do marketers make connections that get people to move? We do so by speaking directly to the thing that makes us who we are: our identity-the anchor of culture--and our subsequent beliefs- the first system of our cultural subscriptions. When we communicate our beliefs to the people who hold the same ideological points of view, it resonates on a deeply emotional level that transcends rationality and inspires people to take action. Why? Because "people like me do something like this." That's the key.
C. Chapman put it simply: when we're trying to make emotional connections, our communications should "start with the soul and end with the sale." We begin with the emotional appeal, which is informed by how we see the world (appealing to the limbic system), and end with the rational argument that appeals to the neocortex. This approach can be applied to just about any context-marketing, leadership, politics, you name it-because it is based on our biology, not our circumstances.
We have all heard the refrain of Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech.
It has been cited as one of the best speeches ever delivered. But an interesting fact about the "I Have a Dream" speech is that Dr. King had delivered it several times before the famous rendition that we all know of from the March for Civil Rights and Equal Pay on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, on August 28, 1963. His first delivery was nine months earlier in North Carolina in November
1962. He had many drafts and iterations of the speech-retooling it, extending it here and shortening it there.
When he took the stage on August 28, 1963, he intended to give a different speech. It was at the behest of the legendary gospel singer Mahalia Jackson that Dr. King decided to change course. She said,
"Tell them about the dream, Martin" after having heard the speech in Detroit months prior, and he went on to give one of the most famous speeches of all time. What made that speech so powerful in that moment was not merely the mechanics of the speech but the conviction that was carried in his words.
people aware of the products and offerings of a company, institution, organization, or person. Historically, advertising has been product focused and led by value propositions (the sale) rather than being ideologically driven (the soul. That was not compelling to Phil.
It wasn't supercompelling to Dan Wieden and David Kennedy, either, which is why one of our isms in the agency today is "Start realizing that what you're supposed to be doing is not advertising; it's evangelizing the faith." We don't make ads for Nike; we preach the gospel that every human body is an athlete. Nike's approach to preaching the gospel to its congregation inspired other companies to adopt this means of communication, perhaps none more famously than Apple.
we all fall for something and behave accordingly, not because it's "true" per se but because it aligns with the story we tel ourselves about the world (ideology) and how we fit into the world (identity); therefore, we act in accordance with it (culture). All we need is for someone to preach the gospel so that we know what to do and how to act. Think of all the amazing things your organization sets out to do to make people's lives better and all the many ways your product might enrich people's day-to-day comings and goings. If preaching the gospel can influence people to buy into a shady product or a questionable company, imagine what it can do for a good product and an upright company.
Unlike traditional marketing communications, the reach that is achieved here is more than just people hearing a message from a company or brand. They hear about it from someone whom they trust, someone like them, which increases the likelihood of adoption for the next person. As the network scientists Nicholas Christakis and lames Fowler posited, "When a small group of people begin acting in con-cert--displaying similar visible symptoms-the epidemic can spread along social network ties via emotion contagion and large groups can become quickly emotionally synchronized. This is the network effect that is activated when you preach the gospel to the congregation of people who see the world the way that you do.

People, not marketing communications, convert people. Marketing communications create an exogenous shock to the system of the networked tribes - within a congregation-and, collectively, the members of the tribe decide whether it aligns with the cultural characteristics of the tribe. 
It's rare for people to show up to a new church for the first time because they saw a flyer or because the church was just there. Instead, guests typically visit a church for the first time because they were invited by someone who is already a member of the church. People talk about how much they've received from attending the church or temple and, subse-quently, encourage their friends and colleagues to attend.
Both religious texts and marketing jargon refer to these people as evangelists, bringers of good news. In the religious sense, the term
"evangelist" is used to describe someone who tries to persuade people to become Christians. In the marketing sense, "evangelists" are people who try to persuade others to try a product that they swear by. We also evangelize for our respective cultural characteristics -telling people to try this, look at something a particular way, or refrain from doing a certain thing based on what "people like us" do. When you preach the gospel to your congregation, you empower evangelists to convert the nonbelievers-the apathetic, the naysayers, and the incredulous.
As the gospel hymnal proclaims, "I once was blind, but now I see," and thus, these newly sighted people feel compelled to tell the good news wherever they go. They, too, preach the gospel on your behalf because they believe. This is the network effect of evangelism.
when you communicate with your people, don't lead with the benefits and features of your offerings. Instead, preach the gospel about your beliefs and the way you see the world. This will connect with people by activating the part of the brain that stirs up emotion and, ultimately, catalyzes behavior.
We've seen examples of gospels preached throughout this chapter like "Opt Outside," "Just Do It," and "Think Different.? These words should not be mistaken for mere taglines. Rather, they are articulations of belief.
They are the expression of the way these brands see the world, and they have a strong gravitational pull on people who see the world similarly.

This pull is so strong that it not only inspires these people to take action but also motivates them to encourage other people like them to take action also.

As you consider this, ask yourself, how would you communicate your company's or organization's worldview? How would you preach the gospel to your congregation? Don't focus on the words so much because that might seem like an intimidating creative exercise-you can save that for the speechwriters and advertisers. Instead, start with a statement of truth, as you did at the end of the previous chapter: "We believe [fill in the blank]." This is the soul.

Once you've communicated the soul, then end with the sale: "We believe [fill in the blank], so we created [fill in the blank: product or orga-nization] to realize this belief" REI believes that a life outdoors is life well spent, so it closed on Black Friday to encourage people to opt for playing outside instead of shopping indoors. Nike believes that every human body is an athlete, so it creates products to help people realize their best athletic self-so people can just do it. Apple believes in challenging the status quo, so it challenged people to think different and consider going against the conventional norm. What do you believe? What is your company's worldview?
The tribe: a broad doorway to enter but a narrow path to belong.

Codify the fan club: Beyhive, yun√®verse
Beyonc√©‚Äôs music was simply the cultural product that people used to communicate their shared worldview and engage in social discourse. Doing so helped them project their  identity that demarcate where they fit in the world. It is through this lens of cultural identity that we establish connections within the tribal networks that we choose to join and subsequently, act in concert with. 
Don‚Äôt look for fans, look for believers. Instead of trying to convince the nonbelievers, activists the collective of the willing, those who already believe. 
Instead of trying to create a community around you, try to find the people who already believe what you believe and facilitate the network that connects them. 
experiences help shape how we see the world, which ultimately informs how we behave in the world.

Meaning
How it‚Äôs made and how it moves from cultural production to cultural consumption 
Meaning is embedded in products by way of four unique fashioning systems:
- Advertising
- News outlets
- Highly esteemed individuals
- Fringe societies 
These are reworked into our identities through four unique ritualised practices:
- Possession
- Exchange
- Grooming
- Divergence
Consult page 130 to break out the above categories 
If you want to get people to move by leveraging the unparalleled influence of culture, it's not enough to just preach the gospel to the congregation; you must also understand how they make meaning.
A shirt is no longer just a shirt. A sneaker is no longer merely a shoe. A car becomes something more than just a vehicle to get me from here to there. Instead, they become a symbol of something far greater
Once again, I think it's helpful to think of this in religious terms. In religious texts, this process would be called consecration, when something that was once common becomes sacred or set apart. It might seem odd to think of a mass-produced product as something people might consider sacred. But according to neuroscientists, it's not a far-fetched idea. In 2011, researchers conducted a magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) study on the brains of Apple fans after they were presented with messaging from the brand. The researchers found that the Apple fans experienced stimulation in the same region of the brain as religious people when exposed to their respective artifacts. The same feelings, reactions, and excitement that are activated in the minds of religious practitioners during worship are conjured in the minds of zealots who subscribe to the cult of Apple when engaging with the brand. Brands can indeed be consecrated and elevated to totem status when meaning congruence is achieved. Plenty of our favorite, most beloved brands, like Apple, are.
The act of consecration illustrates just how powerful meaning making can be for humans and how important meaningful brands are to who we are--both individually and collectively. When it is done well, the meanings and imagery that we associate with brands become shared and salient in the minds of a community, so much so that the process creates a shorthand that gives the brand permission to exist beyond the products it traditionally makes. Try this old adage as a comparison: imagine if Nike were to start a chain of hotels. Can you envision what that hotel might look like? Most likely, yes. But if I told you that the Westin Hotel had decided to make a sneaker, it would be much harder to picture because, in our minds, the Westin is a hotel and nothing else. Its collective meaning stops there. Nike, on the other hand, means so much more. When you think of Nike, you envision rich imagery and relevant associations that extend beyond its prod-ucts. These memory structures are evoked because of the meaning congruence between the gospel Nike preaches and the meaning that people have ritualized into their own identity, which allows the brand to venture into any category it chooses so long as it is in line with how people perceive it. That's superpowerful.
But here's the trick, which you may have already noticed. Although brands and leaders have the ability to preach the gospel in hopes of infusing your product with meaning, they don't actually make mean-ing-people do. Marketing signals intended meaning through the fashioning systems available to us, but people do the meaning mak-ing. The philosopher Roland Barthes underscored this point by saying,
"The author has no sovereignty over his own words. It belongs to the reader who interprets them." While marketers own the brand mark, control how the brand expresses itself, and decide which products the company might offer, it's the people who decide what the brand expression means and whether it fits with their cultural identity. People are the sole meaning makers, and meaning congruence is achieved when the intended meaning of what is signaled is aligned with the meaning that people assign to it. That is to say, meaning is socially constructed, and therefore, it belongs to the people.
As an academic, I became fascinated with the concept of meaning making and its impact on consumption. During my doctoral studies at Temple University, I explored how brands and branded products spread within a community through social contagion- the effects of peer influ-ence-and collective meaning making. When social contagion occurs within a community, brands are not only adopted by the community but also normalized and elevated from utilitarian functions to identity markers.
"Do people like me do something like this?" This is the question we ask ourselves as we navigate our day-to-day lives. The theoretical framework for understanding how social structures-like norms and practices--are established as guidelines for social behavior is referred to as institutional theory. According to this theory, the process of legitimation is shaped by imitation. We observe others who we think are like us to decide what is acceptable behavior for us. The world-renowned scholar of social psychology and influence Robert Cialdini referred to this phenomenon as social proof, where we copy the actions of others to fit in. Social proof provides a signal of what is deemed acceptable behavior among our people, and, subsequently, we receive the behavior as acceptable and act in concert to promote social solidarity.
Legitimation is socially constructed and plays a critical role in the process of meaning making. Every time a community is introduced to something new (an exogenous shock to the system like a new product, new music, or any breaking news that comes through our news feeds and across our screens), members of the community collectively make sense of it (make meaning) and decide whether and how it will be integrated into their culture. Once your brand has been legitimated by the congregation, you're set!
The more the brand is worn or used by community members, the more credence the brand or branded product is given as it undergoes assessment of being deemed "good" and "in" by the community.
The fourth mechanism, reinforcing, illustrates that as people visibly present themselves with a particular brand or speak positively about it, they are essentially casting their vote about the evaluation and legitimation of the brand. The more community members wear the brand or talk about the brand in a positive light, the more the brand is perceived by other community members as "cool" and "acceptable" more broadly. As the saying goes, "Nothing draws a crowd like a crowd"
The reinforcing mechanism facilitates what is performed by the individual and observed by other community members, the result of which helps to drive the social coordination that is needed for social contagion to occur within a community. The reinforcing mechanism is heightened thanks to the prevalence of social network platforms-like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok--that enable greater visibility of the cultural receipts that community members present when their identity projects are on display through the content they post online.
We will discuss this further in the next chapter.
Just as beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, meaning lies in the mind of the interpreter. 
We learn about the world (beliefs), who we are (identity), and how we fit in the world (ideology) through storytelling. Stories are how we teach morality (folklore) and help the interpellation of children so that they become citizens of good standing in society. As a child, I learned about my religion through stories like Daniel and the lion's den and the Exodus from Egypt. They were easily digestible, readily available for memory recall, and, consequently, frequently shared. It's no wonder Jesus spoke in parables because stories serve as an incredible vehicle that helps socialize cultural values and foster community cohesion.

They (fans) were driven by passion, but also by a desire for control. Because of their role in promoting and financially supporting the artists they love, these fans have maintained a creator's hand throughout those artists' careers, treating them as collaborative projects. They take responsibility for every setback and share in the thrill of every success. P23
One Direction arrived at the same time as commercial social media, and they rose at the same time as a new wave of anxiety, isolation, and fractured attention. Their success in that contest doesn't strike me as a coincidence, but the mystery of how so many people were able to find happiness through watching them and talking about them deserves documentation. P24
As one-dimensional "girl power" rhetoric and corporate feminism have once again succeeded in leeching real meaning from the women's movement, pop stars have also appropriated for their own use, to charm greater allegiance from fans by embracing an extremely narrow idea of what i means to support women: supporting the beautiful women they've turned into stars, defending them on the internet by lashing out against anybody who would ostracise them. P25
Every generation's boy band serves a slightly different purpose, but if there is one unifying characteristic I can see, it's that a boy band opens up space. Infatuation is irrational but it can be a precursor to introspection. The experience of bodily joy is an invitation to reconsider the conditions that hold you away from it most of the time. Screaming at pop music is not direct action, and screaming does not make a person a revolutionary, or even resistant, but what screaming can and does do is punctuate prolonged periods of silence. p38
To see or hear me and my sisters at the One Direction concert that night, early August, you would say we were hysterical. We were screaming. I can't speak for everyone in the crowd‚Äî-the Rogers Centre holds more than fifty-three thousand‚Äîbut for me, it wasn't the sight of five famous boys that made me feel like something uncommon was happening. It wasn't the sound of their voices, which I couldn't even hear. It was the fifty-thousand-person shouting match disguised as a sing-along, and the thunderclap of sneakers hitting concrete on every downbeat, eliminating the need to speak or catch any individual eye. Outside, the strange things we were capable of feeling were sneered at of smiled off or commercially packaged as "girl power." but here they were rough and loud. The sounds were ugly. Our hairlines were damp and the tendons in the backs of our knees were screaming. One pair of hands looked just like every other, outstretched in the dark, lining the bottom of other people's camera frames. We knew that our lives would not be fantasies, except for the fact that they were right now. When we shrieked, it was at the knowledge that the moment would end. P48
early adopters innovated the idea that the internet might be organized by affinity. Though early internet fandom was invite-only and near exclusive to well-paid white men, it was also the first evidence of a pattern. Fans became, almost as a rule, the first to adopt new platforms and to invent new features of the internet‚Äîa habit molded by the fact that they were the people with the most obvious incentive to do so. P73
They referred to themselves as hackers, and they acted as if they were above the laws not just of their respective countries but of reality itself. They bragged not only about leaking albums and breaking Twitter, but about things they could not possibly have actually done, like acquiring the ultrasounds of each band member in utero. as well as scans of their passports. They made One Direction into the biggest band in the world not simply by loving them, but by sowing chaos on every online platform they touched. Almost everything they did was worthy of media attention because almost everything they did had never been seen before and literally could not be explained. In 2019, one tan account "leaked" the penis sizes of every member of the band, insisting that Liam Payne's was more than ten inches long. For a year, another fan tweeted in character as "Liam's 10 inch," providing the Twitter bio "I AM THE OFFICIAL 10 INCH OF LIAM PAYNE." On Twitter, anyone who doesn't remember all of that is a "local." This is one of the more casually devastating labels one can acquire in the digital age. A local is a person who belongs to no subculture, understands no intricacies of online humor, follows only the accounts of people they know in real life‚Äî and maybe The Nee York Times?- and retweets only the best generic content. P95
If you haven‚Äôt been around since the early days of One Direction but buy a ticket to a Harry
Styles concert just because you like his pants, you‚Äôre a
local, taking up space that doesn't belong to you. If
you'e confused by fan-made supercuts of Korean pop stars, proliferating in the replies to any viral tweet on any subject, you are a local. Locals have no identity, no
allegiances, no personality, no charisma, no passions,
no curiosity, and no reason to be on the internet at all.
A local joins Twitter to share professional news, which they refer to as "personal news," and to retweet "in-spiring" human interest stories. They love "relatable" content and memes that are long past relevant, and they're also, it's implied, kind of lazy. A local is a person who has not been bothered. They haven't felt moved to do the work of stanning. Maybe it's more useful to say what a local is not: A local is the opposite of the One Direction fan who started a new Twitter account in 2010‚Äîwhile the band was still just a contender on The X Factor‚Äîin order to share "facts" like
"the boys blood types" (Liam: AB. Louis: O. Niall: A.
Harry and Zayn: B.) and each of their heights, in inches and in centimetres (all are under six feet, and Niall is the shortest, at five foot seven, or 171 centimetres). A local would never hang around, waiting for Niall to say that he can't calculate his rising sign because he doesn't remember what time he was born, ready to supply the answer (8:04 a.m.). P96
"Stan Twitter, a broad term encompassing all of the superfans of anything under the sun. (The word "stan" is taken from an Eminem song about an obsessive fan, but is sometimes also referred to as a portmanteau of "stalker" and "fan.") Looking at Twitter through the eyes of a local, you can certainly see that stans are there. You can sense their gravitational pull and the way they drag every conversation into their realm of relevance, making every day online about them and their wishes and their feelings on the many injustices of the Billboard charts. Locals roll their eyes at the antics of Stan Twitter, which seems always to be in hysterics and on the edge of a meltdown, as well as bent on dragging everyone else down with them. But they can't do anything about it. P97
Stan Twitter was molded by these three influences: the emotional valence of Weird Twitter, simultaneously detached and totally out of control; the public-private flattening of Celebrity Twitter, which promised that from now on we would always have access to a behind-the-scenes candor from anyone and everyone; and the tight networking and enthusiastic riffing of Black Twitter, which took the shapelessness of the site and gave it a conversational form. The type of densely connected networks that Manjoo noted-in which people with shared cultural reference points follow each other's accounts, becoming what's known now as
*mutuals-is crucial to fandom, which sustains itself by rapidly escalating the visibility of its passions and funnelling attention to the celebrities and causes it cares about. The idea that hashtags could be used to elaborate on jokes or to sustain conversation on niche or insider-y topics preceded the rise of fan practices such as streaming parties and stan wars. P101/102
Critics of social media often point out that Twitter's functionality and engagement-juicing business model rewards dramatics and over-the-top rhetoric‚Äî suggesting that the platform is its cause. But it's also the emotional stakes of Stan Twitter that set the tone. Scrolling through my timeline at any given moment, theatrics are being pushed to ever more elaborate heights. "If taylor swift murders me DO NOT PROSECUTE HER !!!" one fan writes.? Another shares a photo of Harry Styles, captioning it "he's so sexy break my back like a glow stick daddy." The structure of stan networks is what makes them feel so unavoidable on Twitter-their slang is everywhere, their trends are filling up the sidebar, their wrath is coming down on anyone who makes so much as an offhanded comment about a pop singer whose latest single was not their best. P109
Yet any kind of harassment at scale relies on some of the same mechanisms‚Äîa tightly connected group identifying an enemy and agreeing on an amplification strategy, providing social rewards to members of the group who display the most dedication or creativity, backchannel-ing to maintain the cohesion of the in-group, which is always outsmarting and out-cooling its hapless victims, all while maintaining a conviction of moral superiority. Twitter provides a platform for some of the worst habits of fandom. P116
When I'm doom-scrolling through a timeline full of terrible news and inane bickering, it's a treat to come across all-caps excitement or an ultra-niche joke. Or to wake up and find that there is a conversation going on and that I understand it, and that people are excited about something and I am too. This is the type of thing that can buoy a person for an hour or so at a time. In the same way that holidays give shape to formless years, album promotion and single releases give color to the days that line up one after another. There is a reason to stay up late. There is a reason to wake up early. There is something to do at lunch when you feel like you'd like to cry and take a nap. There are people who swear they hacked into an airport security camera, and aren't you interested to see what they saw, even if you find that totally weird and ultimately quite scary? I like Stan Twitter because it is so peculiar, even as millions of people participate in it and it should have become generic. P117
These basically content-less stories are timeless, even though the mechanisms are modern-the experience of becoming a fan has never been easy to describe. Though social media popularized the idea of stan as an identity cate-gory, as well as the word "stan" itself, it hasn't clarified how a person transforms from "regular" to "stan." The commercial apparatus of the internet is interested only in whether I love One Direction, and not how or why I came to, a question around which there still is‚Äî and now I'm not only speaking for myself-plenty of mystery. P125
Today, it is even less clear what "fan" really means. The people in charge of entertainment proper - ties or consumer brands consider anybody who pays money for the thing they produce a fan. In everyday speech, we say someone is a "fan" of anything they like, no matter to what degree. Coca-Cola refers to people who buy Coca-Cola as fans of Coca-Cola. During an average bit of small talk, I might refer to myself as a fan of shallots or not a fan of bell peppers.
The word "fan" is now synonymous with consumer loyalty; you could be forgiven for considering it a marketing word. Words like "stan" and, especially, words like "trash"-which started in early web fandom, faded out, and were revived on Tumblr in the mid-2010s, just as the commercialization of fans was reaching a new peak‚Äîare aggressively useless for marketing purposes, giving them their charm.!* They signal derangement and depravity and they welcome confusion and disgust. To be One Direction trash is to be the type of fan who is devoted beyond the stereotype of asking Mom to buy a lunch box with Zayn Malik's face on it, or to put up the extra cash for VIP tickets at some arena sponsored by a car company. P129
That being a fan interferes with a person's ability to be financially responsible or perform some of the more mundane tasks of adult life is part of what makes it fun, but it's also a source of conflict.
Women who indulge in frivolities like One Direction concert tickets are often seen as spoiled teenagers (wasting their parents' money), or irresponsible adults (refusing to put that cash in a savings account), or inappropriately self-interested parents (who should be spending everything on their children). And the financial imperative of fandom is not just a personal strain; it also leaves the impassioned open to exploita-tion. It turns a core piece of a person's identity into something that can be bought and sold. Calling yourself "trash" is a way of accepting all of these external characterisations, as well as pointing out they don‚Äôt matter. P130/131
that everyone lives with," says Henry Jenkins, a media scholar at the University of Southern California who is known as the father of fandom studies because of his 1992 book Textual Poachers: Television Fans & Participatory Culture. "At one level, fans are ideal consumers," he told me. "They're deeply invested in the performer and they'll buy all kinds of merchandise related to that performer. But fans reject the basic relationship that is set up by the industry. They're always trying to push beyond the basic exchange of money. The entertainment industry is a tool or mechanism for fandom, but it's not what fandom is." 3 Fans intuitively understand the difference between the official product and their highly personal use of it. They might call themselves One Direction trash to accentuate this distinction outwardly, but individually it's very obvious. Personally, the moments when I've spent money on One Direction do not stand out as important ones-the first One Direction T-shirt I bought at Heinz Field was very ugly, I felt. I've since lost it. Who cares? P131
all combinations of identity are equally unlikely, and we can only be experts in our own. Some of the stigma of fandom comes not from cruelty or genuine disdain but from that simple fact-almost everyone is too complicated to be quickly understood. P135
"The importance of fandom for personal identity is not so much about the disorder caused by the mass media as it is about the order found in devotion."? P136
on the cover of Janice Radway's 1984 book about women fans of romance novels, Reading the Romance: Women, Patriarchy, and Popular Literature, a woman with big hair and a red sweater sits curled up alone on a floral couch in front of matching floral drapes, with a pile of children's toys visible behind her shoulder.
She's reading a novel, which has an illustration on the cover of a man kissing a woman's neck, but she's doing so covertly, alone in the middle of the day. Radway's book was about secrecy, but she was also one of the first scholars to suggest that fandom could be studied without pulling it out of the context of daily domestic life. Daily domestic life was, in fact, what motivated some kinds of fandom, she discovered. The women Radway interviewed articulated their disappointments with the artistic limits of the novels they loved, but they made the case for enjoying them as an indulgence and as a distraction from the sharper disappointments of the real world. They used the books "to diversify the pace and character of their habitual existence," she wrote.? In previous studies of the plight of the housewife, women reported feeling lonely and isolated, and described their social roles as ones that precluded the pursuit of self-interest or personal pleasure. P137
she found was that women who admired Kate Bush for her feminism and her independence "were not always able to translate this into powerful positions in their own lives." They talked about listening to Bush's music when boyfriends or husbands weren't home or were occupied by something else in another room. "Kate Bush is what I'll put on when I'm alone in the house. And I've got some time," one told her. They talked about resenting the men in their lives for not understanding, but they only rarely mentioned rebelling against the arrangement. "An ex-boyfriend was jealous of how, when I got sad, I wouldn't indulge in it with him, I would go and drink or listen to Kate and dance around my room until it's completely gone," one woman said. "I'd be sort of singing out of tune at the top of my voice, like [the song 'Cloud-busting' or whatever, and then walk back in the room and I'd feel great and I could see that he was like numb.‚Äù P139
When Harry Styles fans employed these tactics to juice the numbers for his first solo single, "Sign of the Times," in 2017, 1 asked a fan named Tessa why she was doing it. "I got involved because I love the DIY attitude," she told me.  "It's taking things in your own hands as a fandom." It was even, she ventured, a bit "
"punk." P154/155
There's no reason to interrogate whether One Direction is actually punk, but it is fun to point out a couple of similarities, including the fact that neither were merely widely observed phenomena-they were scenes. The scene in One Direction's case was online rather than downtown or in basements, but it had its own language and culture and signifiers of belonging.
There were other tactical and creative similarities between this pop music fandom and the musical under-grounds that came before. The wealth of music zines in the 1990s, for example, came from geographically dis-persed, passionate, lonely outsiders who both gushed over and critiqued their idols on handwritten pages.
They were not for profit (in fact they lost money), they were collaborative (participatory, transformative), and they were decidedly amateur. They weren't always political, but they were serious about wasting time.
They labored unproductively or counterproductively on something that most people considered emphatically dumb. P155
One Direction's final album, and the system officially debuted with the release of "Perfect" that October.
There was one form for signing up to give a gift and another form for signing up to receive one, each feeding into separate pages of a spreadsheet. The simple code that she wrote would group the data by country and then, as she explained it to me, "walk down each side looking for an open spot. The first open gifter spot gets paired with the first open receiver spot and the match is noted on each side. Once it gets to the end of the file and has gathered all the new matches, it gets the gifters and sends an email with the emails of the people they should gift to." There was no money being exchanged, so she was never nervous about the system being scammed. But it could send out seventy-five emails per minute, so she did sometimes get nervous about blasting out typos or other errors. The system has been used a few dozen times; new projects can be "generated with the push of a button, and then running matches is a push of a button, so over the years it's been low maintenance." P162
The identity of the fandom was reliant on continuing to do this. In the same way that fans transform One Direction's image with fanfiction and fan art, they transform their own image by playing with expectations and flouting the rules. Media presentations of punk music scenes or underground art movements or, in this case, a legion of so-called screaming fangirls give these groups a sense of collective identity, even and especially if the groups disagree with the way they're depicted. This is true for all kinds of subcultures. "De-rogatory media coverage is not the verdict but the essence of their resistance," the sociologist Sarah Thornton wrote in her 1995 book Club Cultures, a history of dance clubs and raves.2 As much as Project No Control was about promoting a One Direction song out of love for One Direction, it was also about refuting the media's portrayal of what One Direction was, and who the people who loved them were. The song was adult, lovingly and sarcastically referred to by its promoters as a "boner song." (Part of the chorus is "Waking up / Beside you I'm a loaded gun!") The call to action wasn't just to bring attention to one song; it was to bring attention to the fact that the band members were adults and serious musicians, and that the fans were adults now, too. P165
Activism in a fandom context has often been concerned with visibility. The causes tend to be identity based, and the aim is often to win from the stars in question some explicit recognition that these identities exist within their audience, that they are impor-tant, and that both star and fan are aligned with a broader political movement related to this identity.
But the choices that Styles fans made during the protests of 2020 reveal a shift or logical progression in this thinking. Fandom activism has been mostly visibility based so far, but it could still be a precursor to something bigger: visibility is a starting point for ac-tivism, and not its end goal. "Pop culture doesn't really change the world," the labor organizer Teo Bugbee wrote for SSENSE that summer. "It's a product to be consumed, an indulgence. But the gift of pop is that it actualizes a fantasy: visions of a world that doesn't yet and maybe won't ever exist."? Harry Styles fans didn't imagine that they would erase the structural problems of the societies they lived in by calling attention to themselves, or that being seen by people who like the same music as they did was overtly political. P241
To hope that Niall Horan deeply cares about my rights is to hope that the other men I love do. To expect that Liam Payne understands why there are so many rainbow flags in the crowd is to believe that anyone should. To want Harry Styles to wave a Black Lives Matter flag onstage is to believe that the world is shifting, and to ask him to do it is to insist on it. We don't need to be told that these men are more a reflection of us than we are of them. P243
We love to fan so much, we'll take nobodies and make them into stars, just because they filmed themselves skate-boarding, drinking cranberry juice, and listening to Fleetwood Mac, or simply because they yodeled for a few minutes in a Walmart. We trot out a new icon every week, adulating them until they do something worthy of a fall, or until we forget. We stan everything now, from Supreme Court justices to new flavors of sparkling water. I have recently stanned a local news blog, a stranger in the comments of a YouTube video, my own sister, a friend's puppy, and a bottle of skin-contact wine. P246
Fandom is the dominant mode of commerce-the backbone of the influencer economy, the force behind the bizarre rise of self-aware Brand Twitter and the dizzying ascent of a handful of pop stars whose personal fortunes are larger than the yearly budgets for some small cities. Brand loyalty has been rebranded as fan-dom, as has passive consumption of all sorts of media, from HGTV to Spotify playlists. The word "audience" slips seamlessly between concert halls and follower counts. The word "love" drifts around like a leaf. P247
The little indignities of being young and the big disappointments of not finding the love you want or of not becoming the person you'd hoped-these things are tempered by fandom, which is such an ugly, boring word. Fandom is an interruption; it's as simple as enjoying something for no reason, and it's as complicated as growing up. It should be celebrated for what it can provide in individual lives, but it should also be taken seriously for what it can do at scale-not because I like it or because being a girl is cool now, but because fans are connecting based on affinity and instinct and participating in hyperconnected networks that they built for one purpose but can use for many others. We need to know what fandom can do and what it can't, and we need to figure out who might try to manipulate it and why. Everything we need is right in front of us. We should talk about how we went on-line, driven by some sort of longing, and why we stayed there, pushing that want outward, over and over, until it couldn't be ignored. P269


### Oversubscribed
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 2015
- **Author**: Daniel Priestley

The brain forms connections based on three key ingredients:

  Time - If you spend a lot of time with people, they start to bond with you. In particular, research into bonding behaviour suggests that spending more than seven hours with someone moves you beyond the "acquaint-ance" category and towards being a "friend."

  Interactions - Having frequent exchanges of communication builds connection. Anyone who had an international pen pal will tell you that you can build a bond based on nothing other than writing letters to one another. In a research paper called "Zero Moments of Truth," a Google thought leader discovered that when people had about 11 interactions with a brand, they were considerably more likely to buy from that brand.

  Locations - Seeing people in different places is another way stronger bonds are built. People who see each other only at work are not as bonded as people who also see each other in social settings or at sporting events. The magic number is four locations according to research into trust building.

If we spent 7 hours together, had 11 interactions between us and met up in 4 separate locations theres little doubt we would feel a bond. It would seem like we are more friends than acquaintances.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Our ape-like ancestors had to learn who was a trustworthy member of the tribe and who was a potential threat. It stands to reason that if two homo sapiens have spent time and interacted in several places with each other they are part of the same tribe.
Therefore the key to carving out your own market is in the formula of 7-11-4. The more people you can clock up time, interactions and locations with, the more people will see you as different, unique and part of their tribe. Through this lens, a famous person is merely someone who has used media and technology to 7-11-4 people.

People who are star-struck by Oprah have probably watched more than seven hours of her shows, interacted with her more than 11 times and seen her in four separate locations (e,g. TV, magazines, social media and newspapers). P32/33
FOUR MARKET POSITIONS THAT GET OVERSUBSCRIBED
The way to being oversubscribed is to achieve an imbalance in which there are more buyers than sellers in your market.
There are four drivers of market imbalances where you'll often see more buyers than sellers:
- Innovation - You offer something new and shiny that no one else offers. There's only one seller (you) and a niche of new buyers who want it. There are therefore more buyers than sellers by virtue of the fact there's only one supplier and more people who want it.
- Relationships - You build such a powerful relationship with buyers that they ignore other sellers. There are more buyers than sellers because buyers aren't interested in other sellers.
- Convenience - You are answering the needs of the market wich the most frictionless expression of what they want. This is about being in the right place, at the right time, with something that meets consumers unmet desires. This creates more buyers than sellers because buyers are reluctant to invest time, money and energy finding alternatives.
- Price - This occurs when you're able to create an imbalance based on price. You've invested into an asset that creates an efficiency others don't have. Crucially, you're still able to offer your products at a price that is profitable but that price is lower than other suppliers can achieve. P43/44
The reason is because people don't buy what others want to sell; they buy what other people want to buy. We buy proper. ties that are in hot spots. We buy clothes that are in fashion. We engage consulting firms that other aspirational brands use. We invest in companies that other investors are throwing money at. Yet countless companies make the mistake of going to great lengths to show how badly they want to sell something. They set up stores everywhere; they mark their prices down; they scream into the streets that they have "cheap" products to sell.
Service providers take on clients without setting any boundaries. They answer calls late at night, get paid late and incur costs. If they don't answer the phone, their message apologises and promises a return call as soon as possible.
Everything about the typical service provider screams, "I will do anything for a sale."
But the more companies do that, the more they turn people off. The more a potential buyer sees you are desperate to sell something the more they wonder why you're so desperate.
Your goal is to place a high value on what you do, work with people who recognise value and exceed their expecta-tions. Set your boundaries, have your terms, protect your space so you can deliver something special.
The skill comes in making something available without forcing it on people - generating output without destroying the demand-and-supply tension. People want social proof; they want to see that others buy from you, others value you and others recommend you. The most powerful way to make something available is in a way that reaffirms the value not the availability of the product. P58/59
They understand that if you treat your clients as aspirational individuals, many more people will aspire to be like them too. Celebrate your clients. Make them the stars of your show. Get famous on their success stories. Take all that money you want to spend on getting a new client and spend it on celebrating your existing clients. Put them high on a pedestal for everyone to see. Rather than beating your drum about yourself, beat the drum for your clients. Help them create a huge success story and then showcase it. Treat your clients like celebrities and let them pull a crowd. In most industries, if you genuinely do focus on the success of your clients you will stand out like a beacon and become massively oversubscribed as a byproduct. Hold your clients up in the highest esteem. Rather than completing a transaction, then looking for the next buyer, take more time to care for the person who just bought from you. Take time to make sure that person feels good about his or her purchase and that he or she is given more than expected. Don't rush off; build the relationship. Whether you like it or not, every buyer is a brand ambassador who informs the market whom your product is built for. When people feel good about buying from you, they will tell people that they bought from you. When they tell people they bought from you, other people like them will want to buy from you too. When people want to buy from you, you're on your way to being oversubscribed. P60/61/62
Your philosophy is made up of your strongly held beliefs and opinions. I's your take on life and it doesn't need to appeal to everyone. Your philosophy is based on your vision for the future, your story about the past, your maxims and values that resonate most strongly with you.
If you were sitting by an open fire with a friend talking about life, the world, friendships, family and the hard lessons you've learned, out would come your philosophy. If you both shared openly what you believe, you'd end up building a stronger bond as friends.
People who only share the features, advantages and benefits of their products box themselves in. They become another vendor trying to sell a commodity. When you have the courage to share your philosophy you become like a champion of a cause or a leader of a movement. What's your philosophy? What are your strongly held beliefs about what you do? What do you stand for? What do you stand against? What is the change you want to see in the world? P69/70
You must give away information freely or cheaply and then charge for the implementation work. P87
Undisciplined innovation out of boredom is dangerous.
If ever you feel the restless urge to create something new, the first place to innovate is in the ecosystem that supports your winning formula. P95
 businesses must begin investing more money into your products and your customer service and less money into advertising and traditional forms of market-ing. Oversubscribed businesses spend money on their existing customers before they spend money on their prospective ones. It seems counterintuitive - but if you get it right, your existing customers go out and do your marketing for you. P113
Why do people pretend that they have no issues with capacity? Why pretend that you can serve everyone when you can't?
I's far better to figure out how many people you can properly serve and then be honest about that number. If your business can take good care of only 21 clients a year, then say so. If you're comfortable providing software to only 10,400 subscribers, then say so. If you're maxed out with
283 restaurant bookings a week, then be clear about it.
Knowing your real capacity is powerful. I's almost impossible to become oversubscribed if you don't know what your capacity is.
Every business has a capacity to deliver a remarkable product or service. Once you try to exceed that capacity, your standards across the board have to drop and people don't get the experience they thought they were going to get. Not just the new clients ‚Äî all of them. They feel disappointed, and its a slippery slope from there. This business will suffer as people learn about your customers underwhelming experiences.
So let's take another look at your business's capacity co deliver. How many clients can you truly serve well? How many products can you really sell? How many customers can you genuinely make feel uplifted? P138
IT BEGINS WITH A HAPPY CUSTOMER
I want you to imagine your perfect client. This person is perfect in every way - enjoyable to work with, they pay on time, they tell their friends about you and they come back wanting more. You enjoy working with them and they think the world of you.
What is it about the person that makes them so perfect?
Let's go back to the time before this person became your client. What were they looking to achieve? What problem were they trying to solve? What was less than perfect in their world?
Every business exists to solve problems for its custom-ers. The reason your perfect clients love you is because you solve a high-value problem for them in a remarkable way.
You meet an unmet need, you scratch an itch, you leave them feeling an emotion they hadn't felt elsewhere.
Unless you can understand this unmet need and what the problem is that you solve for your perfect client you can never generate such a client.
So let's take a look at the problem you solve for people.
High-value products and services are linked to four underlying drivers:
- Save or make money
- Save time or eliminate wastage
- Bring increased emotional benefits
- Ease pain, suffering or negative emotions
P139
A customer buys something. A client keeps coming back. A customer results from a transaction whereas a client results from a relationship.
Your job is to create both. Your business will need to offer products and services at a lower price point so that people can try you out and you can see if they are right for you too. For example, your business might run a promotional event and 100 people buy a ticket for $40. These people are customers of your business because they bought something. P147
You might then decide that you'd be happy to work with 20 out of the 100 on an ongoing basis. Of these 20, you sign on 10 new clients who will buy from you regularly because you nurture the relationship.
You wouldn't have found those 10 clients if you hadn't generated 100 customers first. You need to generate plenty of customers who buy a "product-for-prospects" at a low-risk price point. You then need to discern who would be a great client for you long term.
A barbershop might have 1,000 customers a year who step in for a cut once or twice. They will also have a group of clients who get their hair cut at the same place every month.
The barbershop is wise to be able to know the difference between the two. They will also be wise to know how to turn good customers into raving fan clients.
There's nothing wrong with having a purely transactional interaction with people if the terms are clear.
They buy your product, it's great and they are happy cus-tomers. Ultimately though, the only way to sustain your business is if some of these happy customers become happy clients. P148
Oversubscribed businesses more often talk about something bigger than what they do. They talk about the lifestyle of their customers, they talk about philosophy, they talk about a big problem they want to solve or they talk about the transformation they want to see in the world.
You must look for the bigger game your business is playing for and beat the drum for it in your campaigns. It‚Äôs far more compelling for you and for your customers to get involved in a big game than simply focussing on the basic products and services you sell. P156/157
The best and longest-lasting campaigns centre on pur-pose. The reason you began your business or chose to work on the team you are part of isn't only about the money. You're doing what you do because you believe there's more to it than just the cash. If you can get other people to believe what you believe they will want to be part of what you do too. The key is to talk about something bigger than what you do. P158
People take time to warm up to a buying decision. They typically don't just hear about something new for sale and purchase it right away. They need time to learn, trust, explore and get ready to act. The build-up phase respects this about people and creates a journey of signalling to your market and collecting signals back from your market before you ask for any firm commitments. P163
Rather than asking people to buy, ask them to signal interest. Let them know that there will be a widget for sale soon and if they are interested in more information, can they please email a request or fill in an expression of interest form.
This is a much lower commitment for people. Rather than having to get their credit card out right there and then, all they have to do is fill in a form, click "like" or reply to an email. P166/167
You should have seven hours of digital content available. You should prepare at least 11 interactions across at least four social media channels. Articles, podcasts, videos, apps, questionnaires, reports, illustrations, books, case studies, events and even tweets - all of it counts towards hitting the mark. Get this right and your digital assets will go out and meet people wherever and whenever suits them. P177/178
As you approach your goal of having a lot of signalled interest in your offer, don't slow down. Don't stop running your ads, don't stop releasing your content, don't stop hosting regular events and promotions. Keep doing all the things that work to engage people in your campaign. P182
Transparency: Demand-and-supply tension peaks when it's transparent to potential buyers. When people can clearly see the ratio of people signalling interest relative to the available capacity is high, they feel a sense of urgency to act. Openly showing how many people have signalled or telling people these numbers is the crowning moment of an oversubscribed campaign. P190
my businesses we measure the rhythm using a dashboard called LAPS - leads, appointments, presentations and sales. Leads come in from people who have expressed interest in talking to us, appointments are when a dedicated time to talk has been set in the sales diary. Presentations are recorded when we successfully deliver our scripted sales script (sometimes people reschedule, don't show up or sales conversations go off-script), and sales are made when we take payment, sign terms and conditions and begin the onboarding process.
Different businesses have a different LAPS rhythm.
Some businesses make one sale for every ten leads they generate. Some businesses need to generate 100 leads to make one sale. 
Our LAPS scores over the last two years follow a predictable rhythm:
50 leads
10 appointments
8 presentations
2 sales
P207/208
WITH-OR-WITHOUT YOU ENERGY
Theres a big difference between being a salesperson in an oversubscribed business compared to a business that is struggling to meet its targets. The difference is what I call"with-or-without-you energy. This is a mystical sense of confidence someone has about them when they know they will meet their targets regardless of what any one individual decides - they seem to exude a sense that they will be fine with or without you. This energy is attractive. Humans are drawn towards people who aren't needy. They open up, they banter, they bond and they buy. Conversely, when someone is insecure and seems desperate to make a sale, it has the effect of making a prospect close down and withdraw from the conversation. P213/214
Only when you leave people uplifted will they talk about you in a positive way. If you leave them satisfied (sideways energy) they won't talk about you and all your efforts that went into satisfying them will have been for nothing. If you leave people on a downer, your business will suffer as people talk about the emotions that come from down energy. There's a simple principle when it comes to leaving people uplifted: do something great that people didn't see com-ing. If you buy a Porsche that is supposed to arrive in three days, you'll be pleased if it arrives on time and disappointed if it comes on day four. Strangely, if you're told that it won't be ready for six weeks and then they deliver it in four weeks, you'll be ecstatic. P220/221

It's far too easy to plough ahead into the next campaign without savouring your wins and learning from your failures.
Celebration and innovations are about publicly sharing the success of your campaigns, rewarding the people who made it all possible and looking for ways to make it better next time. There's always a temptation after a campaign to roll up your sleeves and do another one. It's quite addictive when you experience the buzz of a campaign and end up oversubscribed. Instead of rushing straight into the next campaign, you must complete this final phase. You need to hunt down the stories, capture the numbers, interrogate the data - then learn, share, congratulate and reward those involved. You need stories, numbers and insights. Celebration and innovation is about capturing them and using them powerfully. P231
Each watch these brothers make has a story too. Ther√©s the range that was inspired by a B-2 Stealth Bomber pilot who wanted a completely black watch to match his completely black jet. There's the story of how they are the only company to test their watches for supersonic ejector seat deployment from a fighter plane. Theres the story about how every pilot who ejects (and survives) gets a special red bezel fitted to his or her watch. There are stories about adventurers who take Bremont watches to the Arctic, to the depths of the oceans, to the deserts, to the upper atmosphere and deep into remote jungles.
They have watches that you can buy only if you are "pre-authorised military personnel. Ther√©s a timepiece that's hand-painted by Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones. A watch created for Scotland Yard detectives and another for a Hollywood movie about the Secret Service. There's the story they tell about how each glass face is coated with nine layers of anti-scratch protectant. How they have a special way of making their steel stronger than .. well, steel. P233
- Approved copy and images - Marketing people need to have access to an approved marketing message that is written down. They also need access to an image library that represents the brand. Great marketing people can turn this content and imagery into compelling materials but they need you and your company to provide the starting point.
- Approved content - The content could include articles, reports, case studies, ideas, recipes, stories, examples, and the like, This could take the form of audio, video or written content. Marketing people can then use this in a hundred different ways to help drive leads.
- Lead capture systems - Marketing people will need a system for capturing and storing the data of people who are responsive to the marketing materials. Regardless of whether you use an automated online or an old-school phone system, you need to know who's interested and where they came from.
- Measurement benchmarks - Marketing people need to know what an allowable cost per lead, allowable cost per sale and an allowable budget all are for testing ideas.
If they don't have these benchmarks, they will either become paralysed by fear or go rogue with overactivity. P266
- Prolific beats perfect - No company is perfect; everyone makes mistakes. Keep moving forward and keep making your business better. We don't need to be perfect; directionally accurate moves are better than procrastination.
- Innovation never ends - Top companies spend 5% to 15% of their revenues on research, training and devel-opment. Stagnant companies avoid innovation, training, development and research because of what they perceive it costs. You invest in innovation and it doesn't stop. P276


### The Status Game
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 2021
- **Author**: Will Storr

It's in this way that we exist as a tribe, a culture, a people. We come into being as a collective when we connect with like-minded others whose brains process reality in similar ways; who dream the same dream of life. We recognise the same symbols; play the same game. As we do, we become the source of each other's status, the people of the yam. We see the yam, we know what it means, we experience a profound sense of connection with those who perceive this reality as we do. We play the yam game as a single organism, feeding one another status when we judge it's been earned. Over decades of worry, strategy and toil we pursue it, using shared symbols to build great kingdoms of meaning. These kingdoms - these virtual, connected, brain-generated hallucinations of reality - are the realms in which we exist. Our status game is a place. It's our neural territory, our world. P30
The dream state we exist in is founded on objective truth - we're alive on a planet, breathing air under skies. But on these foundations we build an infinite variety of imaginary games. Groups of people gather together, agree what symbols they're going to use to mean 'status', then strive to achieve it. These symbols might take the form of money or power or a plastic dumper truck in a kindergarten toy box. They might be a luxury logo or some sexy abs or an academic prize or a gigantic yam. The dream of the mind projects value onto these symbols - so much value we can be driven to fight and die for them. It tells us a story that says they're of glorious importance: that our gods are real and our pursuit of them is holy.
It makes us feel, not like players of games, but heroes on journeys towards destinations of wonder. We believe this story. It's woven into our perception of reality. It feels no less real than the planet, air and sky. But the truth of human life is that it's a set of hallucinatory games organised around symbols. These games are an act of shared imagination. They come into being in the neural realms of those with whom we choose to play - our kin, our tribe, our people. P31
human life is comprised of three varieties of status-striving and three varieties of game: dominance, virtue and success. In dominance games, status is coerced by force or fear. In virtue games, status is awarded to players who are conspicuously dutiful, obedient and moralistic. In success games, status is awarded for the achievement of closely specified outcomes, beyond simply winning, that require skill, talent or knowledge. Mafias and armies are dominance games.
Religions and royal institutions are virtue games. Corporations and sporting contests are success games. P39
Secondly, we could earn prestige-based status by being virtuous: by demonstrating beliefs or behaviours that served the group's interests. This kind of status is awarded to those who show concern for the public good, display commitment to the group or enforce its rules. They'll also rise up the rankings if they're thought of as being courageous or generous towards their co-players. P43
In order to be able to play the two varieties of prestige game (success and virtuous), our brains had to develop an unusual ability. Prestige games are symbolic.
Unlike physical dominance contests, they're not played with our actual selves, but with our reputation. We can think of our reputation as a symbolic version of us that exists in the minds of others. P43
The brain is coded to seek four main cues that, once detected, trigger their focus. Firstly, we look for the self-similarity cue. We make the assumption we're most likely to learn useful lessons from people like us. We have an inbuilt preference for those who match our age, race and gender. We attend to them, and thus offer them status, preferentially. This is a deep source of much of the cliquish-ness and prejudice that pollutes so many status games. Sadly, it seems automatic. Even very young infants defer to strangers who share their mother's dialect.
Next we look for 'skill cues'. Who, in our game, seems particularly able? Research suggests we start mimicking people who display competence at tasks at around 14 months. We also seek out 'success cues' - status symbols such as an experienced hunter's necklace of teeth; a tribal chief's larger hut; a PhD; a pair of Manolo Blahnik's Lurums. Our desire to signal success in this way is the cause of the
"conspicuous consumption' that occurs across the world. The global luxury market is worth around $1.2 trillion per year, with $285 billion being spent on goods, much of it in Asia. Members of the Amazonian Tsimane tribe who earn more money than others burn up a greater percentage of it on flashy goods such as watches; over in the West, if you want to, you can buy a Franck Muller Aeternitas Mega 4 watch for $2.7 million.
Finally, we look for 'prestige cues': we analyse the body language, eye movements and voice patterns of our co-players to see who they're deferring to. We detect similar clues in the behaviour of prestigious people themselves. Then, we start paying attention to them. These processes are potent and ancient and designed to operate in small groups, not the colossal modern environment of global media and internet. Today it's not uncommon for millions to pay attention to one person simply because millions of others are paying attention to them and for this to become a feedback loop, sending a relatively unremarkable individual into the distant upper reaches of planetary status. Academics call this 'The Paris Hilton Effect'. P49/50
This is how cultures often progress. At the core of the process is our individual tendency to mimic prestigious people in the hope that we'll become prestigious ourselves. P52
often assume money or fancy possessions are the most certain symbols of a person's rank, but the highest-status monk in the world may have less wealth, and fewer Herm√®s ties, than the most junior banker on Wall Street. Influence is different.
Of course, it's not a perfect signal of status; someone low-ranking could influence others with gossip, flattery or lies. But it is an immediate and predictable result of it. Even in small-scale societies, a person's status is commonly expressed in their capacity to influence: they tend to be more prominent in group discussions, to make their opinions known and their suggestions clear, and to articulate the consensus once it is determined'. The outsized influence that high-status players exert can also be measured in how much they talk.
One study of premodern societies found top-ranking members spoke fifteen times more frequently than those at the bottom, and almost five times more than those one rank beneath them.
Influence is a useful signal in dominance games, in which it manifests as power, and also in the two prestige games where it's willingly offered by co-players. Wherever you track trails of influence - of people deferring, altering their beliefs or behaviour to match those of the people above them - you'll find status games being played and won. We frequently measure our own level of status by our capacity to influence. Our status detection systems monitor the extent body language and tone.
to which others defer to us in the subtlest negotiations of behaviour, This is one reason we can take it so personally when our ideas, tastes or opinions are rejected. If human life was strictly rational, weed be likely to feel blank when disagreed with, or perhaps worried a suboptimal decision was being made. We might even feel pleased about it, taking the disagreement as a signal of the group's rigour.
But when our attempts at influence fail - especially in public, especially in the witness of higher-status players - we can become preoccupied, livid, bitter and vengeful. When this happens, we often slip into a more primitive mode of play in which status is not earned in displays of usefulness, but grabbed in acts of dominance. P54/55
They propose four preconditions for an episode to count as humiliating.
Firstly, we should believe, as most of us do, that we're deserving of status. Secondly, humiliating incidents are public. Thirdly, the person doing the degrading must themselves have some modicum of status. And finally, the stinger: the 'rejection of the status to claim status'. Or, from our perspective, rejection from the status game entirely. P67
In severe states of humiliation, we tumble so spectacularly down the rankings that we're no longer considered a useful co-player. So we're gone, exiled, cancelled. Connection to our kin is severed. 'The critical nature of this element is hard to overstate,' they write. 'When humiliation annuls the status of individuals to claim status, they are in essence denied eligibility to recover the status they have lost.' If humans are players, programmed to seek connection and status, humiliation insults both our deepest needs. And there's nothing we can do about it. 'They have effectively lost the voice to make claims within the relevant community and especially to make counterclaims on their own behalf to remove their humiliation.' The only way to recover is to find a new game even if that means rebuilding an entire life and self. Many humiliated individuals find it necessary to move to another community to recover their status, or more broadly, to reconstruct their lives.'
But there is one other option. An African proverb says, 'the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth'. If the game rejects you, you can return in dominance as a vengeful God, using deadly violence to force the game to attend to you in humility. The life's work of Professor Gilligan led him to conclude the fundamental cause of most human violence is the 'wish to ward off or eliminate the feeling of shame and humiliation and replace it with its opposite, the feeling of pride. P67
Social media is a status game. It can't not be: it's human life, unfolding online. It's all there, the success games of the selfie-takers and humble-braggers; the virtue games of the wellness gurus and political campaigners; the dominance games of the mobbers and the cancellers. P83
The model said a person is compelled to act when three forces collide in a moment: motivation (we must want the thing); trigger (something must happen to trigger a desire to get more of it) and ability (it must be easy). Take LinkedIn. At its launch, it visually represented the size of a user's professional network with a hub-and-spoke icon. The bigger the icon, the greater the status. People want status (that's the motivation), the icon generates a sudden urge to get more (that's the trigger) and LinkedIn provides an easy solution, in the use of the site to generate more connections (that's ability). 'Even though at the time there was nothing useful you could do with LinkedIn, that simple icon had a powerful effect in tapping into people's desire not to look like losers,' Fogg has said. P86
He described a way of issuing rewards such that they'd encourage compulsive behaviours. If a programmer wanted to create a certain action, in a user, they should offer a symbol of reinforcement after they'd performed the desired 'target behaviour'. But here was the trick: the positive reinforcement would be inconsistent. You wouldn't always know what you were going to get. 'To strengthen an existing behaviour, reinforcers are most effective when they are unpredict-able, Fogg wrote in 2003. 'Playing slot machines is a good example: Winning a payoff of quarters streaming into a metal tray is a rein-forcer, but it is random. This type of unpredictable reward schedule makes the target behaviour - in this case, gambling - very compel-ling, even addictive.' P86
It's not clear the technologists are fully aware what their users are actually gambling with. Social media is a slot machine for status. This is what makes it so obsessively compelling.
Every time we post a photo, video or a comment, we're judged.
We await replies, likes or upvotes and, just as a gambler never knows how the slot machine will pay out, we don't know what reward we'll receive for our contribution. Will we go up? Will we go down? The great prize changes every time. This variation creates compulsion. We just want to keep playing, again and again, to see what we'll get. P87
Sociologist Professor Cecilia Ridgeway describes experiments that tried to locate the point at which our need for status, once acquired, stabilises. 'There was no point at which preference for higher status levelled off,' she writes. The researchers thought one reason the desire for status is 'never really satiated' is because 'it can never really be possessed by the individual once and for all. Since it is esteem given by others, it can always, at least theo-retically, be taken away?' So we keep wanting more. And more and more and more. P90
One recalled,
'the swell of people, the requests, the letters, the emails, the greetings on the street, the people in cars, the honking of the horns, the screaming of your name... it starts to build and build like a small tornado, and it's coming at you, and coming at you.' Out of nowhere,
'you're worth something. You're important.'
Then comes the brain-story that says they've earned it. 'My life is different in that people kiss my ass and that's not always a good thing because then you start believing that your ass is worthy of being kissed,' said another. 'You have to constantly stay on guard for that. And I think it's very hard. There are times when I exploit that. I take advantage of people sucking up to me, or the power that I wield.' As overwhelming as it is, it's not enough. It's never enough.
Said another, T've been addicted to almost every substance known to man and the most addicting of them all is fame.' P95
T've lost friends... they feel inferior...
You're special and they aren't. The next thing you know, they'd really rather not have anything to do with you? Some superstars expressed disillusionment with the game. But it wasn't the status itself that was the problem. Rather they weren't getting the right kind of status: they had plenty of the success variety, now they wanted status for their virtue. 'You find out there are millions of people who like you for what you do. They couldn't care less who you are.' The flaw is a component of the dream we weave around reality.
It's a quirk in our cognition that keeps us in the game and playing.
If there's any consolation in these stories it's that, paradoxically, it's something of a leveller. The elites, so far above us, will never find what they're looking for. No matter who we are or how high on the scoreboard we climb, life is a game that never ends. P96
Humans aren't heroes on wondrous journeys of progress, we're players programmed for games. To succeed in these games, we seek high-status allies. When we find them, our copy-flatter-conform circuitry switches on. We mimic not just their behaviour but their beliefs. The better we believe, the higher we rise. And so faith, not truth, is incentivised. It's by this process that we come upon many of our most deeply held convictions. It can feel like we choose our beliefs as a cook chooses a recipe, carefully considering an array of options before making a selection. But usually, we believe what our groups believe, obediently copying the perceptions of our elites and accepting the world as they define it. This is how status games are played and how human culture has to work. We can't be expected to test for ourselves every fact on which we have to rely, so instead we look upwards for guidance. We have faith. We believe. And sometimes we end up believing crazy things. P130/131
Maranda was seduced into irrationality by a coalition of high-status Moms who pulled her into their dream of life with their rewards of the great prize. She became possessed by the game, evangelising it to all who knew her, risking her baby's health. Her desire to be a good mother came to depend on the belief that vaccines were harmful.
Achieving the former meant believing the latter, playing their game and winning, for my benefit, my child's benefit, the world's benefit.
Maranda was going to be an amazing Mom and she was going to help save the world. The status on offer was bountiful. When she turned her back and rebelled, she wasn't permitted to simply vanish.
They took the time to let her know: all that status she'd been awarded had been revoked. She was nobody. Worse than nobody. It would be better if she were dead. P135
Beliefs can become sacred too. They frequently do. This is why our reasoning about our sacred beliefs can become so impaired.
When a group of people make something sacred,' writes the psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, they lose the ability to think clearly about it. Beliefs are like my M√∂tley Cr√ºe T-shirt, only infinitely more dangerous. P153
A game's command over its players strengthens when it flips into a mode of war. Connections between players tighten. These effects have been shown in numerous studies. An analysis of social ties between World War II veterans found individuals who experienced combat with one another maintained stronger personal connections even forty years later. Their bonds were intensified yet further if their units had suffered deaths, suggesting, the more intense the social threat, the greater the social bonding'. P167
A study of seventy million messages on the Chinese platform Weibo found the emotion that 'travelled fastest and farthest through the social network' was anger. Meanwhile, studies of mobbing events on Twitter find shamers increase their follower counts faster than non-shamers. P185
Cults are the tightest games of all. They maintain their power by being the sole significant source of connection and status for their players. Earning a place in a cult means actively following its belief system and adhering utterly to its game in thought and behaviour, allowing it to colonise your neural territory entirely. A true cult member has one active identity. Players attracted to them are often those who've failed at the games of conventional life. Alienated, injured and in need, their brains seek a game that seems to offer certainty, in which connection and status can be won by following an absolutely precise set of rules. P193
We seek rules and symbols by which to play a status game. When we find one that's suitable, and that feels right, we're vulnerable to absorbing its story, no matter how berserk. This is true of the Satan-hunters, the anti-vax mothers, the yam growers of Pohnpei, ISIS, the online mobbers and religious adherents world over. One Heaven's Gate veteran of thirteen years told researchers, We were protected.
We didn't like the rules of the world, so we created our own. It was a utopia. Brains want to know, who do I have to be to earn connection and status? Ti and Do wove a fantastic dream that offered precise instructions, telling them exactly who to change into. And so that's what they did. P199
A statusful woman or man who's leading a major game can certainly seem all-powerful when they're being cheered by hysterical crowds under blinding spotlights, gossiped about in world media and deferred to by platoons of acolytes. But the vision is deceptive: it's the subordinates who are ultimately in charge.
Leaders rent their thrones from these subordinates. If their formal position at the heights is to be assured, and they're to remain comfortable behind their giant desk, they must earn true status in the minds of their players. This means succeeding in the grind of making status for the group, and distributing it down through the hierarchy in ways that generally adhere to its rules. It might come in the form of titles or money or medals. P201
There's a critical warning in all this: tyrants often start by telling you what you already believe. When they arrive, they weave their irresistible self-serving dream, promising that you deserve more status, just as you'd always suspected, and pointing accusingly at those you'd already figured to be your enemies - child abusers, conversos, big business, Communists, Jews. They make accusation and gossip; you become angry, enthusiastic and morally outraged.
You begin to play. Once they've got you, they tighten up. P211
WHEN A GAME becomes tight, so does the story it tells of the world. It looks at the hierarchy - at where it sits versus its rivals - and conjures a simplistic, self-serving, moralistic tale that explains how that hierarchy came to be. This story is always the same: we're the virtuous players, deserving of more, and those who block our path are evil. The story is seductive: it's what players want to believe. It becomes a source of status and of hope for more status, and of resentment - an almighty resentment, the rage of the gods that's aimed at the enemy. It is a sacred story. Everyone must believe it in every detail. As the cousins run rampant, threatening and enforcing, we can be swept into it, a leaf in the torrent. The narrative becomes more extreme and more deranged. But we keep believing. It feels so real. We're dreamers, and the dreams we dream are those of our games. We inhabit them. We enact them. And when dreams turn dark we become their nightmares. P217
Studies suggest religious belief doesn't fall upon populations as charismatic holy men ride into towns on pony-back and convert them en masse. Rather, it spreads through personal connections, as friends and family members convince those close to them to join. And it works: research on the effects of religious conversion finds the 'psychological and emotional condition of most converts improves' after joining. P228/229
The Christians conjured hell, which generated salvation anxiety, then presented their game as the only way to escape it. Similarly, New Left activists threaten hell by radically rewriting the terms by which accusations of bigotry can be made, lowering the bar such that mere whiteness or masculinity are signs of guilt. Having generated salvation anxiety, they present their movement as the sole available remedy. Hell's threat can only be escaped with conspicuous, zealous and highly correct play. P276
It's easy to forget we have status to give, that it costs nothing and it never runs out. Creating small moments of prestige means always seeking opportunities to use it. Allowing others to feel statusful makes it more likely they'll accept our influence. Whether we're asking a favour or issuing a task to a subordinate, it's advisable to resist even subtle markers of dominance, allowing them to reach the 'correct' decision without putting them under pressure. If they sense they've had no choice in the matter, they're robbed of the gift of feeling good about their action. How to go about this depends on the rules of your culture, and change especially as we move from West to East. But, researchers find, in individualist societies, 'evoking freedom' can have significant power to persuade. In one study, telling a stranger they were free to accept or refuse a request for money for bus fare increased compliance from 16 to 40 per cent. I suspect this is largely down to status: if someone feels coerced into doing the 'right thing, even if gently, they've only agreed out of dominance. This means the status isn't theirs to enjoy, it's with the player to whom they've deferred.
But if they believe they ve decided freely, they're not weak but virtuous and so able to rightfully enjoy their generosity's reward. P304
A status game is a conspiracy we join to make ourselves feel impor-tant. Once our basic survival needs have been met, and we're connected with others, what's left is the contest. And for what? It's not as if we can go to some bunker in the desert, unlock a steel box and find our status inside it. We can't take our status to bed and give it a kiss. We concoct it, as if by magic, out of those endless symbols: deference, influence, money, flattery, eye contact, clothing, jewellery, professional titles, measures of orange juice, left or right on the plane. We invest the years of our lives into projects that become of all-devouring importance. Up and down and up and down and up and down we go. As we live, we soar and fall, our victories ecstatic, our losses so grave we can be driven to suicide, the bitterness of death seeming sweeter than failure. P309


### Simulacra And Simulation
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Author**: Jean Baudrillard

Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of sim-ulacra. It is first of all a play of illusions and phantasms: the Pi-rates, the Frontier, the Future World, etc. This imaginary world is supposed to ensure the success of the operation. But what attracts the crowds the most is without a doubt the social microcosm, the religious, miniaturized pleasure of real America, of its constraints and joys. One parks outside and stands in line inside, one is altogether abandoned at the exit. The only phantasmagoria in this imaginary world lies in the tenderness and warmth of the crowd, and in the sufficient and excessive number of gadgets necessary to create the multitudinous effect. The contrast with the absolute solitude of the parking lot ‚Äîa veritable concentration camp‚Äîis total. Or, rather: inside, a whole panoply of gadgets magnetizes the crowd in directed flows‚Äîoutside, solitude is directed at a single gadget: the automobile. By an extraordinary coincidence (but this derives without a doubt from the enchantment inherent to this universe), this frozen, childlike world is found to have been conceived and realized by a man who is himself now cryogenized: Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection through an increase of 180 degrees centigrade. P12
Is any given bombing in Italy the work of leftist extremists, or extreme-right provocation, or a centrist mise-en-sc√®ne to discredit all extreme terrorists and to shore up its own failing power, or again, is it a police-inspired scenario and a form of blackmail to public security? All of this is simultaneously true, and the search for proof, indeed the objectivity of the facts does not put an end to this vertigo of interpretation. That is, we are in a logic of simula-tion, which no longer has anything to do with a logic of facts and an order of reason. Simulation is characterized by a precession of the model, of all the models based on the merest fact ‚Äî the models come first, their circulation, orbital like that of the bomb, constitutes the genuine magnetic field of the event. P16
"There is no need to be afraid to see the Communists take power in Italy," it simultaneously signifies:
that there is no need to be afraid, since the Communists, if they come to power, will change nothing of its fundamental capitalist mechanism;
that there is no risk that they will ever come to power (because they don't want to) ‚Äîand even if they occupy the seat of power, they will never exercise it except by proxy;
that in fact, power, genuine power no longer exists, and thus there is no risk whoever seizes power or seizes it again; but further: 1, Berlinguer, am not afraid to see the Communists take power in Italy‚Äîwhich may seem self-evident, but not as much as you might think, because
it could mean the opposite (no need for psychoanalysis here): I am afraid to see the Communists take power (and there are good reasons for that, even for a Communist.
All of this is simultaneously true. It is the secret of a discourse that is no longer simply ambiguous, as political discourses can be, but that conveys the impossibility of a determined position of power, the impossibility of a determined discursive position. And this logic is neither that of one party nor of another. It traverses all discourses without them wanting it to. P17
Everything is metamorphosed into its opposite to perpetuate itself in its expurgated form. All the powers, all the institutions speak of themselves through denial, in order to attempt, by simulating death, to escape their real death throes. Power can stage its own murder to rediscover a glimmer of existence and legit-imacy. Such was the case with some American presidents: the Kennedys were murdered because they still had a political di-mension. The others, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, only had the right to phantom attempts, to simulated murders. But this aura of an artificial menace was still necessary to conceal that they were no longer anything but the mannequins of power. Formerly, the king (also the god had to die, therein lay his power. Today, he is miserably forced to feign death, in order to preserve the blessing of power. But it is lost.
To seek new blood in its own death, to renew the cycle through the mirror of crisis, negativity, and antipower: this is the only solution-alibi of every power, of every institution attempting to break the vicious circle of its irresponsibility and of its fundamental nonexistence, of its already seen and of its already dead. P19
We are still in the same boat: no society knows how to mourn the real, power, the social itself, which is implicated in the same loss. And it is through an artificial revitalization of all this that we try to escape this fact. This situation will no doubt end up giving rise to socialism. Through an unforeseen turn of events and via an irony that is no longer that of history, it is from the death of the social that socialism will emerge, as it is from the death of God that religions emerge. P26
We are witnessing the end of perspectival and panoptic space (which remains a moral hypothesis bound up with all the classical analyses on the "objective" essence of power), and thus to the very abolition of the spectacular. Television, for example in the case of the Louds, is no longer a spectacular medium. We are no longer in the society of the spectacle, of which the situationists spoke, nor in the specific kinds of alienation and repression that it implied. The medium itself is no longer identifiable as such, and the confusion of the medium and the message (McLuhan) is the first great formula of this new era. There is no longer a medium in the literal sense: it is now intangible, diffused, and diffracted in the real, and one can no longer even say that the medium is altered by it. P30
Information in which an event is reflected or broadcast is already a degraded form of this event. P86
The anticipatory illustration of this transformation was Philp
K. Dick's papula‚Äîthat transistorized advertising implant, a som of broadcasting leech, an electronic parasite that attaches itself to the body and that is very hard to get rid of. But the papula is still an intermediary form; it is already a kind of incorporated prof thesis, but it still incessantly repeats advertising messages. P89


### Status and Culture
- **Year Read**: 2025

> Why do individuals cluster around arbitrary behaviors and take deep meaning from them? This phenomenon arises because individuals, in seeking status, must publicly communicate certain conventions as proof of membership in particular groups. P89

"Even if all actors received the same salary," writes the philosopher Bertrand Russell, "a man would rather act the part of Hamlet than that of the First Sailor.‚Äù P7
This is why we care more about higher relative income than absolute income. A study found that 70 percent of research subjects would give up a silent raise in salary for a more impressive job title. P8
Cultural changes are never random, nor do they befall us as plagues. Trends happen because individuals choose to take up new behaviors. And when we examine the history of cultural change, there are clear patterns in how humans move from one practice to another. Sixty years before the moptop, social scientist William Graham Sumner seemingly predicted how it would rise and fall: "A new fashion of dress seems at first to be absurd, ungraceful, or indecent. After a time this first impression of it is so dulled that all conform to the fashion." In almost all instances, new behaviors begin as an exclusive practice of smaller social groups-whether elites or outsiders ‚Äîand then eventually spread to the wider population. This is true for the diffusion of superficial hairstyles but also applies to things not considered "fashions": practical technologies like cars and hybrid seed corn, delicacies like chocolate and gin, political and spiritual beliefs, and the succession of artistic movements in modern art. The thing we call culture is always an aggregation of individual human behaviors, and if taste were the mere product of random idiosyncrasies and irrational psychologies, culture would display no patterns, only noise. The fact that preferences in these disparate fields follow a similar rhythm of change suggests there must be universal principles of human behavior at work‚Äîthe presence of a "cultural gravity" nudging humans into the same collective behaviors at the same time. P-XIV
Social approval makes us feel that our talents are recognized, and this leads to increased self-esteem. "The familiar yearning to 'be someone' in life," writes Cecilia Ridgeway, "is not so much about money and power as about being publicly seen and acknowledged as worthy and valuable by the community." While we may be embarrassed by outright status seeking, most of us are comfortable with receiving recognition for significant achievements. P9
even if we are seeking esteem rather than superior treatment, we need some form of superior treatment to perceive the esteem. The demand for tangible status benefits thus can't be separated from a desire for respect. This is why bureaucratic institutions always provide more perks to employees who move up the hierarchy. At the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in the 1950s, every rise to a higher position meant a larger office, with wood rather than glass enclosures, and increased proximity to the chairman. P9
Delinquent and marginal subcultures make a good home for those lacking most forms of capital, as they reward members for a rejection of mainstream values. Fringe groups flip the script and value extreme negations of traditional virtues. In reaction to the Puritan work ethic of proper society, the Beats decided "all effort was uncool, a hassle. From this perspective, membership in alternative status groups appears to be a clever strategy for oppressed and unprivileged individuals to maximize their status. But there is an obvious flaw in this approach: our most immediate community can only provide local status-the ranking inside the small group. Research has shown that local status is more important to personal happiness than global status, especially for self-esteem. And life is easier when living among sympathetic peers. But even if we hide in an alternative status group, we can't escape our global status-the general ranking within broader society. P20/21
Status ultimately describes our specific placement as individuals within a network of others, and how we are treated in that position. When we impress others, our treatment improves. But until now, we've ignored an even more basic determinant of status. To be a good member in any group requires following certain rules. This is where status and culture first intersect. P23
Conventions are not just floating molecules that make up culture but also wield remarkable powers over humans in three key ways: (1) they regulate our behavior; (2) they become internalized as habits; and (3) they change our perception of the world. And from whence do conventions draw their power? Sta-tus. We ultimately follow conventions to gain social approval and avoid social disapproval, and in doing so, they change our behaviors and organize the data we gather from our senses. p28/29
For a convention to take root within a community and become "regular" behavior, it must become part of common knowledge-where individuals know something, know that others know it, know that others know that they know it, and know that others know that they know that they know it, ad infinitum. P29
Once es. tablished, conventions then draw an additional power from emotional responses to expectations. Our brains prefer when other people meet our expectations, because this means we don't have to expend extra mental energy on thinking through alternatives. When others fail to meet our expectations in a negative way, we become frustrated and angry-even in times when the underlying behavior has no material impact on us. We then convert these emotional re-sponses, either positive or negative, into outward expressions of our feelings.
Meeting expectations elicits smiles and cheers. When they aren't met, the sociologist George Homans writes, an individual has in effect been deprived of a reward, and he repays deprivation with hostility." P30
We learn conventions from our family and friends through the chameleon effect, where we unconsciously mimic our peers in body movements and speech. We learn that these behaviors are associated with certain meanings and values: what's right, what's wrong, what goes with what. This process converts conventions into habits. P31
Internalization unlocks the final power of conventions: setting our perceptual framework for observing the world. Our senses may gather information, but that information is then interpreted through a screen of conventional habits, beliefs, and knowledge. Depending on our cultural background, we hear, see, remember, and pay attention to things differently. The perception of time, for example, is a convention. P32
Culture, writes anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, consists of "meaningful orders of persons and things." Conventions explain not only why certain persons do certain things, but the origin of collective meanings and orders. To follow the same arbitrary rules as another individual is to be part of the same "collectiv-ity." As groups share certain practices, those practices form social bonds. The convention of wearing lederhosen and dirndl defines Bavarians as a people. Debutante balls are a rite of passage for wealthy WASP women. Russians don't just drink vodka as a stiff tipple‚Äîit's the lifeblood of the nation. P33/34
The literary scholar Raymond Williams called culture "one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language." Indeed: the 1952 book Culture: A Critical Review of Concepts and Definitions alone offers 150 defini-tions. Even our colloquial usage remains ambiguous: Is culture a way of life, fine art, pop culture, or organizational norms? While we may be no closer here to settling on a singular definition, we at least know what culture is "made of*: conventions are the individual units of culture. Everything we point to as
"culture" ‚Äîcustoms, traditions, fashions, and fads‚Äî exists as conventions. P35
Conventional differences by status tier are inevitable because there must be observable ways to mark differences in rank. A superiority of position should be reflected in the superiority of benefits. While organizations often contrive these differences, they can also occur naturally. Stratification determines the social space we inhabit, and our family and closest friends tend to be at similar status levels. After spending time in the same community, we come to share the same habitus and lifestyle conventions. These are expressed in the expense, quality, and design of possessions; speech patterns (use of polite language or slang): means of earning a living: self-presentation (dress, hair, makeup, fit-ness); location and quality of domiciles; and hired services (do we mow the lawn or do we pay someone else to do it?). Max Weber noted, "Social status is normally expressed above all in the imputation of a specifically regulated style of life to everyone who wishes to belong to the circle." Lifestyle, in other words, is both a requirement of social rank and an expression of it. P37
recent neuroscience experiment discovered that subjects preferred cheaper wines when unaware of the price, and then preferred the taste of expensive wines once prices were revealed. More interestingly, the subjects' pathways of brain activity changed along with their change in preference. P40
While there may be a philosophical origin to this obsession with individual distinction, these demands also match the internal logic of status structures. Emulation requires imitating the group above you, but for those at the top of the hierarchy, there should be no one to imitate. A good indication of having super-high status, then, is being able to get away with distinctive acts. The moral duty of self-actualization is actually a status duty: individuals at the top of the hierarchy must pursue unique behaviors and distinctive choices. The suits of former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak didn't just use custom wool but had pinstripes that spelled out his name in Arabic. P46
Humans have an innate predisposition to imitate, but in modern times we must reconcile this with a moral duty to be distinct. To gain status, then, we must balance four specific requirements of imitation and distinction:
- To secure normal status, we must imitate group conventions.
- To avoid low status, we must counterimitate rival conventions.
- To gain higher status, we must emulate conventions with high status value.
- To achieve the highest status, we must strive for individual distinction through unique behavior.
No individual can pursue all four simultaneously. Instead we're likely to choose a specific risk-mitigation strategy that best matches our status position. P48
Boasting and bragging thus become an implicit sign of low status. Here we land upon the principle of detachment: very high-status individuals should seem detached from active attempts to gain status. In fact, the most successful status claims should never appear to be status claims. P34

As we just learned, status appraisers look for clues in our demeanor and possessions to estimate status, and so the most obvious way to signal a high social position is to show off certain goods or engage in certain behaviors with high status value. This begins inside the home. Simone de Beauvoir writes,
"The home is not merely an interior within which the couple is shut away; it is also the expression of that couple's standard of life, its financial status, its taste, and thus the home must need be on view to other people." P56
Companies that produce luxury goods, from Louis Vuitton to Tiffany, Rolex, and Dom Perignon, understand the need for alibis, and their marketing provides detailed explanations of great craftsmanship, rare materials, unsurpassed com-fort, and the highest levels of quality control. And yet, luxury goods never work as luxury goods based purely on functionality. They also must have status value. The philosopher Jean Baudrillard writes, "The functionality of goods comes afferward, adjusting itself to, rationalizing and at the same time repressIng these fundamental structural mechanisms." The best proof of this can be found in the fact that luxury goods that are initially exclusive to a small segment of the population, such as nutmeg or air-conditioning, cease to be luxuries once they're widely available despite their quality improving over time. P57
the principle of associativity:
*When two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination requires a habit of passing easily from one to the other. If the first is to appear, we lay our account that the second is to follow." Status symbols rely on these associations. Harvestores became symbols of farming success, because the most successful farmers owned them. Playing squash suggests relations with the high-status people who play it. Status symbols, therefore, must have clear associations with high-status groups. Poorer farmers paid double for Harvestore silos because they promised a means to be appraised as wealthy. Beck name-dropped noise artist Keij Haino because the most erudite indie music fans loved his music. P58
Cachet powers the often elusive concept "cool"; nothing can be cool without associations to particular groups of high-status individuals, namely, musicians, celebrities, and popular teens. P59
There are five common signaling costs. The first and most obvious is money.
Since wealth correlates to status position in capitalist society, most status symbols are expensive. English-style horseback riding has status value because it's an expensive skill to learn. The second cost is time. A PhD signals experience because it takes years and years of education and validation from established professors. This is why traditional societies treat older people with high status: their valuable wisdom can only be accrued from decades of living.
The third cost is exclusive access. High-status people are granted access to restricted locations where they attend special events. There they acquire things unavailable to others. In the world of rowing, the Cambridge University Boat Club's mint-blue Beefeater T-shirt is very prestigious, since the only legitimate ways to acquire one are rowing for Cambridge or trading jerseys with them after a race. The fourth cost is cultural capital-knowledge of conventions acquired through spending time among high-status people. For example, espousing credible and detailed opinions about the relative merits of Harvard College's freshman dorms Thayer and Holworthy is limited to the school's former and current undergraduates.
The final cost is norm breaking. As we learned in the last chapter, breaking a convention leads to social disapproval. Using their leeway to be different, elites can more easily pay the costs of social disapproval. Arthur Capel, Coco Chanel's wealthy lover, dined in elegant restaurants wearing a casual sports jacket rather than a formal dinner jacket "because it pleased him to give an impression of strength and rudeness." P60
In understanding the effects of status on individual behavior, we have arrived at a paramount concern of modern life: Who am I? We now understand the myriad difficulties of landing upon clear answers. Which "I" are we talking about? There appear to be three: persona, identity, and self. In signaling, we build personas-observable packages of signals, taste, sensibility, immutable characteristics, and cues absorbed from our upbringing and background. Others use this persona to determine our identity. At the same time, we have a self within our minds, known only to us. Persona, identity, and self are never quite the same. All of the additions, subtractions, and redactions made for status can cause our persona to feel like an ersatz, sanitized, cardboard cut-out version of the self. And if others classify us based on this highly edited persona, our public identity may drift far from "the real me.‚Äù P82
Why do individuals cluster around arbitrary behaviors and take deep meaning from them? This phenomenon arises because individuals, in seeking status, must publicly communicate certain conventions as proof of membership in particular groups. P89
Youth subcultures are rarely artistic or design collectives, which means their stylistic innovations tend to adapt, warp, and blend preexisting looks and commodities rather than create new looks from scratch. The teddy boys pilfered their signature look from Savile Row. Most subcultural and countercultural innovation thus begins as bricolage-the mixing and matching of preexisting styles and objects to imbue them with new meanings. Since teenagers are confined to a distinct geographical space with limited pocket money, they must repurpose common objects to construct a unique look. The first British subcultures focused on tailored suits, because tailoring was standard at the time.
Mods rode scooters because they couldn't afford cars. Early bosozoku bikers in Japan wore their dokajan cold-weather jackets from construction and janitorial jobs. P130
Unambiguous distinction requires tall fences, and there must be high sig. naling costs to keep out normies. Subcultural and countercultural styles require significant expenditures of time, money, and reputation. The tailored teddy boy suit was extremely expensive for a young blue-collar laborer in the 1950s, and the teds' elaborate, time-consuming quiffs were a form of conspicuous waste. Both dissuaded halfhearted teds. When groups have anticommercialist tendencies, like punks and hippies, the requirements may instead focus on extravagant changes to appearance, such as body piercings and mohawks. P130
Over time rebellious styles eventually become conventional within alternative status groups and, at that point, members must adhere to them to receive normal status. To be a Juggalo‚Äîa fan of the music group Insane Clown Posse-members are expected to dress in oversized red and black garments, drink large quantities of low-priced Faygo soda, tattoo the band's Hatchetman logo on their bodies, and greet fellow Juggalos with the salute "whoop whoop." Just as the wealthy have cultural capital, subcultures develop subcultural capi-tal. There is a correct way of being a Juggalo just as there's a correct way of being Old Money. Upon visiting the Gathering of the Juggalos music festival, the non-Juggalo writer Kent Russell noted the ubiquity of the Hatchetman logo: "I saw the Hatchetman stitched onto shirts, pants, cheer shorts, bikini tops, beanies, caps, and shoes; shaved into heads and chests; and tattooed on so many pounds of lacquered flesh‚Äîon arms, shoulders, forearms, over the avian bones on the backs of hands, across necks and asses, in the lee of breasts, on calves, clavicles, and feet." Russell, by contrast, lacked this subcultural cap-ital: no Hatchetman tattoo and no familiarity with the right way to say "whoop whoop." He quickly fell to the lowest status within the Juggalo micro-society and spent his days under "showers of refuse" as festival goers constantly threw garbage at him. P131
The requirements on members can get more extreme when subcultures start to shrink in size. As ganguro scared away normal girls from the kogyaru style, the remaining members developed their own unique looks on the streets of Tokyo, incomprehensible to outsiders. This phenomenon echoes a principle seen in linguistics: languages of small Indigenous populations develop more complicated grammars and more difficult sounds than widely spoken tongues. When subcultures are small cults, the most dedicated members receive more status than hangers-on, which incentivizes the core members to indulge in even more extreme practices with higher signalling costs. P132
Because alternative status groups can never actually replace the masses, they can achieve influence only through being imitated. But how do their radical inventions take on cachet? There are two key pathways: the creative class and the youth consumer market. P134
The primary sites for subculture/creative-class cross-pollination have been art schools and underground music scenes. The punk community, in particular, arose as an alliance between the British working class and students in art and fashion schools. Once this network was formed, punk's embrace of reggae elevated Jamaican music into the British mainstream as well. Similarly, New York's downtown art scene supported Bronx hip-hop before many African American radio stations took rap seriously. P135
With so many cultural trends starting among the creative classes and ethnic subcultures, companies may not understand these innovations but gamble that they will be profitable in their appeal to middle-class youth. P136
Mass media, in needing to explain subcultures to readers, defines the undefined‚Äî and exaggerates where necessary. P137
This simplification inherent in the marketing process lowers fences and signaling costs, allowing anyone to be a punk or hip-hopper through a few commercial transactions. P137
In October 1967, a group of longtime counter-cultural figures held a "Death of the Hippie" mock funeral on the streets of San Francisco to persuade the media to stop covering their movement. Looking back at the sixties, journalist Nik Cohn noted that these groups' rise and fall always followed a similar pattern:
One by one, they would form underground and lay down their basic premises, to be followed with near-millennial fervor by a very small number; then they would emerge into daylight and begin to spread from district to district; then they would catch fire suddenly and produce a national explosion; then they would attract regiments of hangers-on and they would be milked by industry and paraded endlessly by media; and then, robbed of all novelty and impact, they would die. P137/138
In the eighteenth century, philosopher Immanuel Kant asserted three still authoritative criteria for artistic genius: (1) the creation of fiercely original works, (2) which over time become imitated as exemplars, and (3) are created through mysterious and seemingly inimitable methods. P145
When artists cut too deep into standard conventions in pursuit of artistic value, audiences often renounce the changes. Music listeners are happy with small surprises but expect conformity to familiar notions of melody, harmony, and rhythm. Yet deep cuts are required to achieve artistic value. This is why Gertrude Stein noted that all important art is "irritating" and Marcel Duchamp quipped, "A painting that doesn't shock isn't worth painting." In the early days of modern art, indignation became a clear sign of artistic success. With the appearance of Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase at the 1913 Armory Show in New York, the painting "baffled and outraged so many visitors" that it became "the most famous painting of the modern era."
This poses a logistical problem for creators: until they are accepted as high-status artists, transgressive behavior may be met with social disapproval and low status. "Matisse and Picasso in 1900," theorist Ren√© Girard reminds us,
"were considered incompetent by 99 per cent of their contemporaries." This helped form the stereotype of the struggling and misunderstood artist, sacrificing all immediate human relationships in pursuit of deeper universal truths.
Aspiring artists must have a high tolerance for societal rejection‚Äî enough self. confidence, perspicacity, faith, or insanity to continue working against the backlash. Defiance is easy for self-centered narcissists; George Orwell listed
"sheer egoism" as a primary motivation for writers. Mental disorders that numb the fear of punishment also improve the calculus of risk taking. P152
The most natural candidates for radical invention, then, are creators who see themselves as having low status. At the bottom of the pyramid, there is little to lose and much to gain. This explains why youth tend to be more radical than adults. Andy Warhol believed that "it's easy for a young person to support new ideas. He comes onto the scene fresh. He doesn't have any positions to defend or modify, no big time or money imested. He can be a brat, say whatever he pleases, support whatever and whoever he wants to without having to think, Will they ever invite me to dinner again?" Poor treatment and inadequate respect also give young creators an easy way to justify their rebellion. P153
The battle for artist status in the pursuit of artistic value turns the art world into a battlefield between aspiring and established artists, Upstarts propose radical oppositions to the reigning styles, and once they succeed, a new generation of upstarts propose radical oppositions to the previous radical oppositions.
This is why the story of art tends to be dialectical. Instead of slow, incremental changes to methods and concepts, art movements quickly swing from one extreme position to another. The social realist school of painting promoted the idea that art should work to support revolutionary politics. The next generation, the abstract expressionists, demolished the social realist approach by refusing to use representational forms that could be used for propaganda. Then the pop artists rejected the abstract expressionists' purism by adding elements of commercial kitsch to the canvas. A decade later, minimalists renounced pop's colorful media references to make the most reductionist art possible. P154
Once most audiences expect new art to conform to esoteric ideas, such as silence as music, the ideas are no longer radical but simply conventional. In more commercial fields like popular music, this stage of conventionality entices less ambitious creators to turn formerly dangerous innovations into audience-friendly works. The pop critic Dan Ozzi notes, "Whenever a truly innovative artist defines a new sound, it gets carbon copied for at least a decade until what's left is an embarrassing abomination bearing almost no resemblance to the spirit of the original." Nirvana topped the charts with stylistic innovations borrowed from the cult act the Pixies; once grunge hit big, Nirvana copycats Bush and Stone Temple Pilots collectively sold fourteen million albums for their work in obvious grunge idioms. P158
The literary critic Jonathan Culler writes, "Aesthetic expression aims to communicate notions, subtleties, complexities which have not yet been formulated, and therefore, as soon as an aesthetic code comes to be generally perceived as a code... then works of art tend to move beyond this code." Radical artists are often uneasy about their particular idiolect becoming too well understood. Jean Baudrillard notes that the successful artist is "condemned" to repetition, as audiences will ask for more and more of the same. The music group the KLF warned that most hit artists "spend the rest of their lives as a travelling freak show, peddling a nostalgia for those now far off, carefree days.‚Äù P159
The most ambitious artists never abandon their rebellious spirit and attempt to negate their own conventions on a constant basis. To prevent a "School of Satie," Erik Satie altered his own style for each new series of compositions.
In the 196os John Cage pledged, "Whenever I've found that what I'm doing has become pleasing, even to one person, I have redoubled my efforts to find the next step." This ceaseless search for innovation tends to work very well for already established artists. In the case of the Beatles, writes critic Ian MacDon-ald, "They kept [their music) from becoming stale by continually investigating new methods and concepts: beginning and ending songs in the wrong key, employing modal, pentatonic, and Indian scales, incorporating studio-effects and exotic instruments, and shuffling rhythms and idioms with a unique versatility." P159
Societies that value radical invention end up with more diverse cultural ecosystems, a great abundance of artefacts, and a multiplicity of sensibilities. But there are two downsides. First, radical negation tends to "exhaust" itself by eventually doubling back to the starting point. The modernist poet Octavio Paz stated in the early 1970s, "Rebellion has turned into procedure, criticism into rhetoric, transgression into ceremony. Negation is no longer creative." This led to much confusion about next steps in the "postmodern" era, and one approach was to return to pre-modern ideas. At the 1981 A New Spirit in Painting exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, the critic Peter Fuller was shocked to find that the youngest painters had embraced traditional painterly goals: "apparent conservatism" was now the "progressive" option. P162
Second, the demands for originality pushed many artists to disturb conventions so deeply embedded in our brains that the artworks never found large audiences. Art that rejects aesthetic value in pursuit of artistic value often stagnates as "meta-art"-intellectual exercises with little emotional resonance.
Without inclusive aesthetic experiences, art becomes trapped within elite cir-cles. Few enjoy Schoenberg's twelve-tone composition as they do Beethoven's classical harmonies.
For most of the twentieth century, status struggles provided us with the incredible cultural diversity we enjoy in the present. And our gratitude for the artists and creators has, in turn, created more tolerance toward a wide range of
"deviants" who may provide our future cultural enrichment. This direct connection between status competition and creativity has also revealed a few clues to solving the final part of the Grand Mystery of Culture: Why do we change behaviors over time, and why do some behaviors persist? For both art and subcul-tures, cachet from elite groups brought more individuals into new styles and persuaded initial detractors to accept irritating and norm-breaking ideas. Next, in part 3, we'll better understand exactly why populations move from one convention to another: the internal mechanisms inherent in the status hierarchy work as a motor for perpetual cultural change. P163
most people seek to participate publicly in new trends only where status value becomes obviously positive. P173


### The Medium is The Massage

Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication. The alphabet, for instance, is a technology that is absorbed by the very young child in a completely unconscious manner, by osmosis so to speak.
Words and the meaning of words predispose the child to think and act automatically in certain ways. P8
The family circle has widened. The worldpool of information fathered by electric media-movies, Telstar, flight-far surpasses any possible influence mom and dad can now bring to bear. Character no longer is shaped by only two earnest, fumbling experts. Now all the world's a sage. P14
There is a world of difference between the modern home environment of integrated electric information and the classroom. Today's television child is attuned to up-to-the-minute "adult" news-inflation, rioting, war, taxes, crime, bathing beauties-and is bewildered when he enters the nine-teenth-century environment that still characterizes the educational establishment where information is scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented, classified patterns, subjects, and schedules. P18
A new form of "politics" is emerging, and in ways we haven't yet noticed.
The living room has become a voting booth. Participation via television in Freedom Marches, in war, revolution, pollution, and other events is changing everything. P22
The shock of recognition! In an electric information environment, minority groups can no longer be contained-ignored. Too many people know too much about each other. Our new environment compels commitment and participation. We have become irrevocably involved with, and responsible for, each other. P24
All media work is over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us un-touched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the massage. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. P26
Electric circuitry profoundly involves men with one another. Information pours upon us, instantaneously and continuously. As soon as information is acquired, it is very rapidly replaced by still newer information. Our electrically-configured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition. We can no longer build serially, block-by-block, step-by-step, because instant communication insures that all factors of the environment and of experience coexist in a state of active interplay. P63
The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation, we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear-view mirror.
We march backwards into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land. P74/75
We impose the form of the old on the content of the new. The malady lingers on. P86


### Start With Why
- **Year Read**: 2025
- **Publication Date**: 2009
- **Author**: Simon Sinek

Most of the answers we get, when based on sound evidence, are perfectly valid. However, if we're starting with the wrong questions, if we don't understand the cause, then even the right answers will always steer us wrong ... eventually. The truth, you see, is always revealed... eventually.
The stories that follow are of those individuals and organizations that embody this pattern. They are the ones that start with Why. P1 
Just about every person or organization needs to motivate oth ers to act for some reason or another. Some want to motivate a purchase decision. Others are looking for support or a vote. Still others are keen to motivate the people around them to work harder or smarter or just follow the rules. The ability to motivate people is not, in itself, difficult. It is usually tied to some external factor. Tempting incentives or the threat of punishment will often elicit the behavior we desire. P6
Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act.
Those who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people who act not because they are swayed but because they are inspired. They are able to create a following of people-supporters, voters, customers, workers-who act for the good of the whole not because they have so, but because they want to.
Those who are inspired are often willing to pay a premium, put up with inconvenience and sometimes even endure personal suffer-ing. For those who are inspired, the motivation to act is deeply personal. P6
Not only bad decisions are made on false assumptions. Sometimes when things go right, we think we know why. But do we really? That a result goes the way we want it to does not mean we can repeat it over and over. I have a friend who invests some of his own money. Whenever he does well, it's because of his brains and ability to pick the right stocks, at least according to him. But when he loses money, he always blames the market. I have no issue with either line of logic, but either his successes and failures hinge upon his own prescience and blindness or they hinge upon good and bad luck. It can't be both. P13
There's barely a product or service on the market today that customers can't buy from someone else for about the same price, with about the same quality, the same level of service and about the same features. If you truly have a first-mover's advantage, it's probably lost in a matter of months. If you offer something actually novel, someone else will soon come up with something similar and maybe even better.
But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their customers, most will tell you it's because of superior quality, fea-tures, price or service. In other words, most companies have no clue why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating realization. If companies don't know why their customers are their customers, odds are good that they don't know why their employ. ees are their employees either.
If most companies don't really know why their customers are their customers or why their employees are their employees, then how do they know how to attract more customers and employees or encourage loyalty among those they already have? P16
Fear, real or perceived, is arguably the most powerful manipulation of the lot. P22
When fear is employed, facts are incidental. Deeply seated in our biological drive to survive, that emotion cannot be quickly wiped away with facts and figures. This is how terrorism works.
Though the statistical probability that we could get hurt by a terrorist is quite low, it is the fear that it might happen that paralyzes a population.
Again, perhaps the most powerful of all the manipulations, fear is often used with far less nefarious motivations. We use fear to raise our kids. We use fear to motivate people to obey a code of eth-ics. Fear is regularly used in public service ads, say to promote child safety or the need to wear seat belts. There used to be a famous PSA to help combat drug abuse among teenagers. A man stood facing the camera holding an egg. "This is your brain," he said. Then he cracked the egg into a hot frying pan. It sizzled and spluttered.
"This is your brain on drugs," he continued. "Any questions?" And another ad intended to scare the hell out of any brash teenager:
"Cocaine doesn't make you sexy ... it makes you dead." P22
If anyone has ever tried to sell you anything by stoking your fear of missing out, being left out or even dying, they are putting a proverbial gun to your head to help you see the "value" of choosing their product. Or perhaps it's just a banana. P23
Our impatience often pushes us to implement short-term responses to our long-term desires. A management consultant friend of mine was hined by a billion-dollar company to help it fulfill is goals and aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no matter the issoe, the company's managers were ahways drawa to the quicker. cheaper option over the better long-term solution. Just like the habitual dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it right the first time," she said of her client, "but they always have the time and money to do it again.‚Äù P24
Given the money and fame that go with it, the social pressure to want to exert social pressure seems to have replaced aspirations to be almost anything else. A 2019 study found that a whopping 86 percent of thirteen-to-thirty-eight-year-olds aspire to be "in-fluencers" (and 12 percent of them already think they are). P26
When a company offers too many options for the same product, it is a sure sign they are using novelty to help drive their sales. Novelty is a quick fix because it's easy to produce. Real inno-vation, in contrast, is special, different and rare. When something is actually innovative, the choice is obvious. P28
Manipulations don't build loyalty, but they do cost money.
Lots of money. And when money is not as available to fund those tactics, not having a loyal following can cost a company even more. P30

P37
The Golden Circle finds order and predictability in human behavior. Put sim-ply, it helps us understand why we do what we do. The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much more we can achieve if we remind ourselves to start everything we do by first asking why. P38
And it all starts from the inside out. It all starts with Why.
Before we explore the applications of The Golden Circle, let me first define the terms, starting from the outside of the circle and moving inward.
WHAT: Every single company, organization and individual on the planet knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no matter what industry. Every one of us can easily describe the products or services our companies sell or the jobs we do. WHATs are easy to identify.
HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether you call them a "differentiating value proposi-tion," "proprietary process," "unique selling proposition" or "your strengths," HOWs are often given to explain how something is different or better. Not as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the differentiating or motivating factors in a decision. It would be false to assume they are all that is required to inspire people to act. There is one missing detail:
WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don't mean to make money‚Äîthat's a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?
Most of us think, act or communicate from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good reason‚Äîwe go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say WHY we do WHAT we do. P39
Let's look at that Apple example again and rewrite it in the order Apple actually communicated. This time, the example starts with WHY.
In everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.
And we happen to make great computers.
Wanna buy one?
It's a completely different message. It actually feels different from the first one. We're much more eager to buy a computer from Apple after reading the second version‚Äîand all I did was reverse the order of the information. There's no trickery, no ma-nipulation, no free stuff, no aspirational messages, no celebrities.
Apple didn't simply reverse the order of information: their message started with WHY, a purpose, cause or belief that had nothing to do with WHAT they did. WHAT they did-the products they made, from computers to small electronics‚Äîno longer served as the reason to buy, they served as the tangible proof of their cause. P41
People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy
WHY you do it. P41
Apple did not invent the MP3, nor did they invent the technology that became the iPod, yet they are credited with transforming the music industry with it. The original multi-gigabyte portable hard drive music player was actually the Zen, invented by Creative Technology Ltd., a Singapore-based technology company that rose to prominence by making the Sound Blaster audio technology that enables home PCs to have sound. In fact, Apple didn't introduce the iPod until twenty-two months after Creative's entry into the market. This detail alone calls into question the assumption of a first mover's advantage. Given their history in digital sound, Creative was more qualified than Apple to introduce a digital music product. The problem was, they advertised their product as a "5GB MP3 player." It is exactly the same message as Apple's "1,000 songs in your pocket." The difference is Creative told us WHAT their product was and Apple told us WHY we needed it. P44
For all those who will try to convince you that Apple computers are just better, I cannot dispute a single claim. All I can offer is that most of the factors that they believe make them better meet their standard of what a computer should do. With that in mind, Macintoshes are, in practice, only better for those who believe what Apple believes. Those people who share Apple's WHY believe that Apple's products are objectively better, and any attempt to convince them otherwise is pointless. Even with objective metrics in hand, the argument about which is better or which is worse without first establishing a common standard creates nothing more than debate. Loyalists for each brand will point to various features and benefits that matter to them (or don't matter to them) in an attempt to convince the other that they are right. And that's one of the primary reasons why so many companies feel the need to differentiate in the first place-based on the flawed assumption that only one group can be right. But what if both parties were right? What if an Apple was right for some people and a PC was right for others? It's not a debate about better or worse anymore, it's a discussion about different needs. And before the discussion can even happen, the WHYs for each must be established first. P49
In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking "WHAT should we do to compete?" the questions must be asked, "WHY did we start doing WHAT we're doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?" But don't take my word for it. None of this is my opinion. It is all firmly grounded in the tenets of biology. P51
Our need to belong is not rational, but it is a constant that exists across all people in all cultures. It is a feeling we get when those around us share our values and beliefs. When we feel like we belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As humans we crave the feeling and we seek it out. P53
Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful that we will go to great lengths, do irrational things and sometimes, like the Sneetches, spend money to get that feeling. We want to be around people and organizations who are like us and share our beliefs.
When companies talk about WHAT they do and how advanced their products are, these things may appeal to us, but they do not necessarily represent something to which we want to belong. But when a company clearly communicates their WHY, what they be-lieve, and if we believe what they believe, then we will sometimes go to great lengths to include those products or brands in our lives. This is not because they are better but because they become markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear.
Our natural need to belong also makes us good at spotting things that don't belong. It's a sense we get. A feeling. Something deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel how some things just fit and some things just don't. Dell selling MP3 players just didn't feel right because Dell defined itself as a computer company, so the only things that belonged were com-puters. Apple defined itself as a company on a higher mission, and so anything they did that fit that definition felt like it belonged. In 2004, they produced a promotional iPod in partnership with the iconoclastic Irish rock band U2. That made sense. They would never have produced a promotional iPod with Barbra Streisand, even though she's sold vastly more records than U2 and may have a bigger audience. U2 and Apple belonged together because they shared the same values and beliefs. They both pushed boundaries. P54
Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those decisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under these conditions, manipulative strategies that exploit our de-sires, fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're forced to make these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason‚Äî these companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures, features and benefits upon which to base our decisions.
They don't tell us WHY. P58
We all know someone who is a die-hard Mac lover. Ask them WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you "Well, I see myself 
as someone who likes to challenge the status quo, and it's important for me to surround myself with the people, products and brands that prove to the outside world who I believe I am." Bio-logically, that's what happened. But their purchase decision was made in the part of the brain that controls behavior not language.
So they will provide a rationalization: "It's the user interface. It's the simplicity. It's the design. It's the high quality. They're the best computers. I'm a creative person." In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty are deeply personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's all about how they see themselves. P62/63
Remember the Honda and the Ferrari? Products are not just symbols of what the company believes, they also serve as symbols of what the loyal buyers believe. Not too long ago, people with Apple laptops, for example, loved opening them up while sitting in an airport. They liked that everyone knew they were using a Mac. It was an emblem, a symbol of who they were. That glowing Apple logo said something about them and how they saw the world. Did anyone notice when someone popped open the lid of their Dell computer? No! Not even the people using the computer cared. Dell had a fuzzy sense of WHY, so their products and their brands didn't symbolize anything about the users. P63
Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the outside world who they are and what they believe. Again, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If a company does not have a clear sense of WHY, then it is impossible for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary currency of differentiation. P64
Starting with WHY is just the beginning. There is still work to be done before a person or an organization has the ability to in-spire. For The Golden Circle to work, each of the pieces must be in balance and in the right order. P65
For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be actions. It's not "integrity," it's "do the right thing." It's not
"innovation," it's "look at the problem from a different angle." It's not "honesty," it's "tell the truth." Articulating our values as verbs gives us clearer direction on how to act in any situation. We can hold each other accountable to measure our values or even build incentives around them. Asking people to have integrity doesn't guarantee that their decisions will always keep customers' or clients' best interests in mind; telling them to always do the right thing does. P67
The WHY serves as a compass for the long journey and the HOW guides the route we choose, the steps we have to take, along the way. P67
Consistency of WHAT
A WHY is a belief. It lives in our imagination. HOWs are the actions we take to realize that belief. But we live in the tangible world. Everything we say and everything we do has to prove what we believe. WHATs are the tangible results of our actions: our products, services, marketing, PR, culture and whom we hire, everything people can see. If people don't buy WHAT you do but WHY you do it, then all these things must be consistent. The only way people will know what we believe is by the things we say and do, and if we're not consistent in the things we say and do, no one will know what we believe.
It is at the WHAT level that authenticity happens. "Authentic-ity" is that word so often bandied about in the corporate and political worlds. Everyone talks about the importance of being authentic. "You must be authentic," experts say. "All the trend data shows that people prefer to do business with authentic brands*
"People vote for the authentic candidate." "That marketing piece you're working on," a CEO might instruct, "please make it a little more authentic." The problem is, that instruction is totally un-actionable.
So what do companies do to be authentic?
The common solution is hilarious to me. They go out and do customer research and they ask the customers, what would we have to tell you for us to be authentic? This entirely misses the point. You can't ask others what you have to do to be authentic.
Being authentic means that you already know who you are and what you stand for. What does a politician say when told to be
"more authentic"? How does a leader act more "authentically"?
Without a clear understanding of WHY, the instruction is completely useless.
What authenticity means is that our Golden Circle is in bal-ance. It means that everything we say and everything we do we actually believe. This goes for management as well as employees.
Only when that happens can the things we say and do be viewed as authentic. Apple believed that its original Apple computer and its Macintosh challenged the dominant IBM DOS platforms.
Apple believed that its iPod and iTunes products were challenging the status quo in the music industry. And we all understood WHY Apple did what it did. It was because of that mutual understanding that we viewed those Apple products as authentic. P67/68
Ask the best salesperson what it takes to be a great salesper-son. They will always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the product you're selling. What does belief have to do with a sales job? Simple. When salespeople actually believe in the things they are selling, the words that come out of their mouths are au-thentic. When belief enters the equation, passion exudes. It is this authenticity that produces the relationships upon which all the best sales organizations are based. Relationships also build trust.
And with trust comes loyalty. Without a balanced Golden Circle, there is no authenticity, which means no strong relationships, which means no trust. And you're back at square one selling on price, service, quality or features. You are back to being like everyone else. Worse, without that authenticity, companies are more likely to resort to manipulation: pricing, promotions, social pres-sure, fear, take your pick. P69
It's hard to make a case to someone that your products or services are important in their lives based on external rational factors that you have defined as valuable (remember the Ferrari versus the Honda). However, if your WHY and our WHY corre-spond, then we will see your products and services as tangible ways to prove what we believe. When WHY, HOW and WHAT are in balance, authenticity is achieved and we feel fulfilled. When they are out of balance, stress or uncertainty exists. And when that happens, the decisions we make will also be out of balance.
Without WHY, we are more easily motivated by aspiration or fear. At that point, it is we, the buyers, who are at the greatest risk of ending up being inauthentic. If we buy something that doesn't clearly embody our own sense of WHY, then those around us have little evidence to paint a clear and accurate picture of who we are. P74
When we can only provide a rational basis for a decision, when we can only point to tangible elements or rational measurements, the highest level of confidence we can give is "I think this is the right decision." That would be biologically accurate because we re acti vating the neocortex, the "thinking" part of our brain. At a neocor tical level we can verbalize our thoughts. This is what's happening when we spend all that time sifting through the pros and cons. listening to all the differences between one product or another when we're reading all the reviews.
When we make gut decisions, the highest level of confidence we can offer is "The decision feels right," even if it flies in the face of all the facts and figures. Again, this is biologically accurate, because gut decisions happen in the part of the brain that controls our emotions and decision-making, not language. Ask the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders what their secret is and invariably most say the same thing: "I trust my gut." The times things went wrong, they will tell you, "I listened to what others were telling me, even though it didn't feel right. I should have trusted my gut." It's a good strategy, except it's not scalable. The gut decision can only be made by a single person. P78/79
The reason the human race has been so successful is not because we're the strongest animals‚Äîfar from it. Size and might alone do not guarantee success. We've succeeded as a species because of our ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of people who come together around a common set of values and beliefs. When we share values and beliefs with others, we form trust. Trust allows us to rely on others to help protect our children and ensure our personal survival. The ability to leave the den to hunt or ex-plore, with confidence that the community will protect our family and our stuff until we return, is one of the most important factors in our survival as individuals and the advancement of our species. P88/89
The same can be said for any place that has a strong culture or recognizable personality. We do better in cultures in which we feel like we belong. We do better in places that reflect our own values and beliefs.
Now consider what a company is. A company is a culture. A group of people brought together around a common set of values and beliefs. It's not products or services that bind a company together. It's not size and might that make a company strong, it's the culture-the strong sense of beliefs and values that everyone, from the CEO to the receptionist, all share. So the logic follows, the goal is not to hire people who simply have a skill set you need, the goal is to hire people who, first, believe what you believe. The goal is not to take a job simply because one company pays you more than another, the goal is to work in a culture that, first, believes what you believe. P90/91
Apple did not have a lock on good ideas; there are smart, innovative thinkers at most companies. But great companies give their people a purpose or challenge around which to develop ideas rather than simply instructing them to "be more innovative." Companies with a clear sense of WHY tend to ignore their competi-tion, whereas those with a fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing. They study their competitors in hopes of adding the features and benefits that will make their products bet-ter, only further entrenching themselves in WHAT they do. This is how companies like Colgate find themselves with forty-one different types of toothpaste (not including the ten for kids). P101
Herb Kelleher, the visionary behind Southwest Airlines, understood this better than most. He recognized that to get the best out of his employees he needed to create an environment in which they felt like the company cared about them. He knew that they would naturally excel if they felt the work they did made a differ-ence. When a journalist asked Kelleher who came first to him, his shareholders or his employees, his response was heresy at the time (and to a large degree still is). "Well, that's easy," he said, "employees come first, and if employees are treated right, they treat the outside world right, the outside world uses the company's product again, and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it works and it's not a conundrum at all.‚Äù P111/112
Whom do you trust more, someone you know or someone you don't know? What do you trust more, a claim made in a piece of advertising or a recommendation from a friend? Whom do you trust more, the waiter who tells you "Everything on the menu is great," or the waiter who tells you to avoid the chicken casserole?
Are these questions too easy? Then how about this one: Why should anyone trust you?
The feeling of trust is lodged squarely in the same place as the WHY-the limbic brain-and it's often powerful enough to trump empirical research, or at least seed doubt. And it is that limbic brain that is constantly evaluating everything we hear, trying to assess if we can trust what we hear or if we need to exercise can-tion. This means that everyone else's brain is doing the same thing when we say anything
Personal recommendations go a long way. We trust the judg ment of others. And those we know trust us. It's part of the fabric of strong cultures. But we don't trust the judgement of just anyone.
We are more likely to trust those who share our values and beliefs. And when we believe someone has our best interest in mind because it is in their best interest to do so, the whole group benefits. The advancements of societies depend a great deal on the trust shared between those with a common set of values and beliefs. P112
In his 1962 book Diffusion of Innovations, Everett M. Rogers was the first to formally describe how innovations spread through society. Thirty years later, in his book Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore expanded on Rogers's ideas to apply the principle to high-tech product marketing. But the Law of Diffusion of Innovations explains much more than just the spread of innovation or technology. It explains the spread of ideas.
If you don't know the law, you're likely already familiar with some of its terminology. Our population is broken into five seg. ments that fall across a bell curve: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. P117

P117
loyalty is when people are willing to suffer some inconvenience or pay a premium to do business with you, sometimes even turn down a better offer from someone else. Something the later majority rarely does. P121
According to the Law of Diffusion, mass-market success can only be achieved after you penetrate between 15 percent and 18 percent of the market. That's because, according to Rogers, the carly majority won't try something new until someone else has tried it first. Once you hit that critical mass, a social phenomenon happens: the tipping point just tips. It is at this point that a product gains mass-market acceptance, a company becomes more stable or an idea becomes a movement. When that happens, the growth is not only exponential, it is automatic. It just goes.
The goal of business then should not be to try to sell to anyone who might buy our product-the majority-but rather to find people who believe what we believe, the left side of the bell curve.
They perceive greater value in what we do and will happily pay a premium or suffer some sort of inconvenience to be a part of our cause. They are the ones who, of their own volition, will tell others about us. That 15 to 18 percent is not made up of people who are simply willing to pay for what we're offering. It is the percentage of people who share our beliefs and want to incorporate our ideas, our products, our services or our brand into their own lives as WHATs to their own WHYs. They look to WHAT we do as a tangible element that demonstrates their own purpose, cause or be. lief to the outside world. Their willingness to pay a premium or suffer inconvenience to use our product or service says more about them than it does about us and our products. Their ability to easily see WHY they need to incorporate our products into their lives makes this group the most loyal customers. They are also the most loyal sharcholders and the most loyal employees.
No matter where they sit in the spectrum, these are the people who not only love us but talk about us. Get enough of the people on the left side of the curve on our side and they encourage the rest to follow. P122
We've got a new product.
It pauses live TV.
Skips commercials.
Rewinds live TV.
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without your needing to set it.
Compare the original list of features and benefits with a revised message that starts with WHY:

If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy do we have a product for you.
It pauses live TV.
Skips commercials.
Rewinds live TV.
Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without your needing to set it. P124/125
 
In this version, all the features and rational benefits serve as tangible proof of WHY the product exists, not the reasons to buy, per se. The WHY is the belief that drives the decision, and WHAT it does provides us a way to rationalize the appeal of the product. P125
It wasn't the details of his plans that earned him the right to lead. It was what he believed and his ability to communicate it clearly that people followed. In essence, he, like all great leaders, became the symbol of the belief. Dr. King came to personify the cause. To this day we build statues of him to keep that belief alive and tangible. People followed him not because of his idea of a changed America. People followed him because of their idea of a changed America. The part of the brain that influences our behavior and decisions does not have the capacity for language. We have trouble saying clearly, in emotional terms, why we do what we do and offer rationalizations that, though valid and true, are not powerful enough to inspire others. So when asked why they showed up that day, people said simply, "Because I believe." More than anything else, what Martin Luther King Jr. gave us was clarity, a way to explain how we felt. He gave us the words that inspired us. He gave us something to believe in, something we could easily share with our friends. Everyone at the Mall that day shared a set of values and beliefs. And everyone there that day. regardless of skin color or sex, showed up with common cause. It was that shared belief that fueled a movement to change a nation. P129
Energy can motivate. It is easy to see, easy to measure and easy to copy. Charisma, in contrast, is hard to define, near impossible to measure and difficult to copy. But charisma is what we need if we want to inspire. Charisma has nothing to do with energy. Energy comes from a good night's sleep or lots of caffeine. Charisma comes from a clarity of WHY, from absolute conviction in an ideal bigger than oneself. P134
All great leaders have charisma because all great leaders start with WHY. It wasn't Bill Gates's passion for computers that inspired us when he led Microsoft, it was his undying optimism that even the most complicated problems could be solved. He believed we could find ways to remove obstacles to ensure that everyone could live and work to their greatest potential. And that belief inspired his vision of a PC on every desk. It wasn't just that Gates saw the impact of WHAT the new technology could do; he also saw WHY we needed it. And that is what drew us to him. P134

Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfilment comes from why we do it. P7
"Hold on," you might say. "Let's be honest here--aren't most people working to earn money? That's the obvious
"why." First, money is a result. Though it is a part of the picture, it's not what inspires any one of us to get out of bed in the morning. And for the cynics out there who think they or others really do get out of bed for the money, the question we ask is, what is the reason they want the money. Is it for freedom? To travel? To provide a lifestyle for their kids that they didn't have? Is it to keep score and show they have done more than others? The point is. money isn't the thing that drives people. WHY goes much deeper to understanding what motivates and inspires us.
It is the purpose, cause or belief that drives every organization and every person's individual career. Why does your company exist? Why did you get out of bed this morning? And why should anyone care? P13
We sell paper. We offer the highest quality product at the best possible price. Lower than any of our competitors. Wanna buy some?
This is a very rational pitch. It states clearly what the company does and attempts to persuade potential buyers to choose its product over others' on the basis of features and benefits. Though this approach may work now and then, at best it will result in a few recurring transactions. As soon as the buyer finds a better deal, they will be gone, because the pitch doesn't differentiate this specific vendor from other companies in any way that truly matters. Loyalty is not built on features and benefits. Features and benefits do not inspire. Loyalty and long-lasting relationships are based on something deeper. 
Let's try the pitch again. Let's start with WHY:
What good is an idea if it can't be shared? Our company was founded to help spread ideas. The more ideas that are shared, the greater the likelihood those ideas will have an impact in the world. There are many ways to share ideas; one is the written word. That's where we come in. We make paper for those words. We make paper for big ideas. Wanna buy some? P14

The outer section of the Golden Circle-the WHAT-corresponds to the outer section of the brain‚Äîthe neocor tex. This is the part of the brain responsible for rational and analytical thought. It helps us understand facts and figures, features and benefits. The neocortex is also responsible for language.
The middle two sections of the Golden Circle-the WHY and HOW-correspond to the middle section of the brain, the limbic system. This is the part of the brain responsible for all our behavior and decision making. It's also responsible for all our feelings, like trust and loyalty. But unlike the neocortex, the limbic system has no capacity for lan-guage. This is where "gut feelings" come from. It's not our stomach. It's a feeling we get about a decision we have to make that we struggle to explain. P17
The WHY exists on a macro level and a micro level. A com pany has a WHY, each division or team has a WHY and every individual has a WHY. The opportunity is to make sure the right people are working in the right places in the right company. P24
If you're an entrepreneur, discover your WHY so you can communicate what is singular about your company to your employees and clients or customers. For exam-ple, Apple may not always sell the very best products-ahem, battery life-but if you're someone who wants to
"Think Different," you probably swear by Apple on an emotional level you'd never experience with, say, Dell.
And knowing your WHY makes it easier to hire the right people. Every entrepreneur wants a staff of true believers, but how can you find those people if you arent clear on what, beyond hard work, you need them to be lieve in? If you know your WHY, you can hire people who believe what you believe, which is a much stronger motivator than money. Knowing your WHY is the secret to hiring for "fit.‚Äù P28/29

‚Ä¢ If you want to discover the WHY of the entire organization it will come from one of two sources: The first is from the founder's WHY, which draws from the origin story. If the founder is no longer available, we have a method that engages people in the organization to identity the WHY based on the best elements of the existing culture. P29
STEP 1: GATHER STORIES ANS SHARE THEM
At ts core the WHY is an origin story. By looking to our past and teasing out the most significant threads‚Äî-the ex periences we've had, the people we've been influenced by, the lives we've touched and the highs and lows we've facel‚Äîwe can identify patterns. For individuals, our WHY is fully formed by our late teens. To uncover our WHY we must bring together our standout memories-our defining moments-and examine them to find the connections. For tribes, the WHY also comes from the past-either the origin story of how the company was unded or from specific stories shared by other members of the tribe that represent what makes them proud to be a part of the tribe. Either way, discovering your WHY is like panning for gold in the river of the past: the gold is there.
Jost in the debris of the river, hidden by rushing water Only when you take the time to pan for the significant moments of the past, retrieving them nugget by nugget, will they turn into treasure. P31
The more specific the memories, the better. "Our family book a driving vacation every summer"‚Äî nope, that's too general to be helpful. "Our family ahways took driving va-cations. One year the car broke down in the desert, and we had to hitchhike to Albuquerque. I was seriously scared but I remember thinking that I needed to be strong so that my younger sister wouldn't be scared as well, so 1 made up a game to entertain us"‚Äîthis is the kind of specific detail you'll need! Rediscovering the details, the feelings, the conversations, the lessons learned will offer clues to who you are and what your WHY is. The more stories you can recover and share, the more data you'll compile. And the more data you can draw on, the more easily you'll begin to see the recurring ideas or themes. P31/33
You'll come up with as many specific, impactful memories as you can‚Äîat least ten. Once you've got them all down, you'll choose about five or six that made the biggest difference in your life and share them in as much detail as you can. P33
STEP 2: IDENTIFY THEMES
As you pan for your stories and share them, themes will start to emerge, insights about yourself or your team that you may never have expressed before. As the process unfolds, one or two of those nuggets will seem to shine brighter than all the others.
They will feel bigger, more important. They will shine so brightly that you'll point to them and say, "That's me-that's who I am," or "That's us‚Äîthat's our team." These themes become the foundation of your Why Statement. P34
STEP 4: DRAFT AND REFINE A WHY STATEMENT
With one or two shiny nuggets in hand, you're ready to take a crack at your Why Statement. Try to make yours:
- simple and clear
- actionable
- focused on the effect you'll have on others, and
- expressed in affirmative language that resonates with you.
Eventually, you will put your Why Statement into this format:
TO__________ SO THAT_________.
P35
The first blank represents the contribution you make to the lives of others. The second blank represents the impact of your contribution. So could your Why Statement be, "To finish every project ahead of schedule and under budget, so that I can be pro-anted and earn enough to save college money for my kids? No. Even if you see that as the truth right now, your Why Statement will go deeper than that. It is everlasting and must be relevant in both your personal and professional life. It is a statement of your value at work as much as it is the reason your friends love you. We don't have a professional WHY and personal WHY. We are who we are wherever we are. Your contribution is not a product or a service. It's the thing around which everything you do the decisions you make, the tasks you perform. the products you sell-aligns to bring about the impact you envision. P35/36
Here's how Simon Sinek expresses his WHY: To inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, we can change our world. The impact Simon seeks is for each of us to change our world, in big and small ways, for the better. Fantastic! But this goal is too broad and abstract on its own. It's his contribu-tion, what he actually does on Monday morning to make change happen, that gives direction to his desired impact.
The contribution part-to inspire others‚Äîgives Simon the focus he needs. The books he writes, the talks he gives, the workshops he conducts are WHAT he does-all of them infused with his cause‚Äîto inspire people. And the more effectively he inspires others, the more likely every person who is drawn to his work will make a change to our world for the better. P36/37
FIND YOUR WHY
river of your past, recalling stories of your life and career from which your significant themes can emerge. Only you can retrieve those stories from your memory, but when it comes to interpreting them, a second set of eyes and ears‚Äîa partner‚Äîis invaluable. Listening to your sto-ries, your partner can offer a perspective that is nearly impossible to see for yourself. Finding the right partner is an important part of the process. That doesn't mean you must find a trained psychologist or coach, just someone who genuinely wants to help you find your WHY. The partner is there to help identify the golden thread, the recurring themes and ideas that are the basis for your WHY. P41
At its core, the WHY is an origin story. Who we are is the sum total of all the experiences we've had growing up-the lessons we learned, the teachers we had and the things we did. In order to help your companion discover their WHY, you'll need to listen to stories from their past. Their WHY represents who they are at their natural best and will be revealed through specific stories and experiences that affected their life and shaped who they are. P44
YOUR ROLE
Your main role is to listen to the stories then ask thoughtful questions that will help them dig deeper to find the underlying meaning of each memory. As you listen, you'll take notes, identifying themes, ideas, words or phrases that recur in the stories; these themes will weave together into a golden thread to define who they are at their natural best. P44
HOW TO BE AN ACTIVE LISTENER
Active listening is about hearing more than the words that are said It's about understanding the meaning, motivation or emotion behind those words. Some of the techniques of active listening are sim-ple: Make eye contact; acknowledge verbally and nonverbally what the other person says (e.g., offer affirmation like, "go on," or nod your head as you understand things); invite them to say more about what happened or how they feel about it. Pay particular attention to nonverbal cues. Facial expressions, body language and even long pauses all serve as clues as to how the story makes them feel. The stories you will hear are some of the most meaningful of their life, and they may evoke strong feelings. Pride, love, fulfillment, fear, be-longing, loneliness-all these and more might show up in different ways. Some people get more animated-use their hands more, sit on the edge of their seats, raise their voices-others may get choked up or become soft-spoken and reflective. P45
We often find that people begin their stories with straightforward facts-what happened, when it happened and who was there. It's what we naturally do when we tell stories. While these details are important to set context to what will be shared next, they won't help you get to the WHY, because the WHY is connected to feelings.
Sharing feelings is a very important part of the process. The goal is to help them express the feelings and emotions they felt at the time. It's really hard to connect with a feeling when we speak in generalities. We can't stress enough that the stories your companion shares need to be very specific. P46
Remember, the WHY is not who we aspire to be, it's who we truly are. The stories are tangible proof of who they truly are. It's your job to ask follow-up questions until you uncover the reason this specific story is significant. 
- How did that make you feel?
- What is it about this experience that you absolutely loved?
- You've probably felt this same feeling before. What is it about this story that makes it special? (Eg, if they say they "felt proud," you can ask them what about this pride was different from other times they felt it.)
- How did this experience affect you and who you've become?
- What was the lesson from that experience that you still carry with you today?
- Of all the stories you could have shared with me, what makes this specific one so special that you chose to tell it?
- If someone else features prominently in the story, ask them how that person made a difference in their lives or what they love or admire about that person. P47/48
The better you capture the themes of how they felt, the easier it will be to put together the Why Statement that feels really authentic to them. P49
In addition to the recurring themes that you'll listen for in each story, there are two other main components to look for: contribution and impact. These are the building blocks of the final Why Statement-the contribution the person makes to the lives of others and the impact of that contribution over time. We write it in this format:
TO__{contribution}__ SO THAT__{impact}__.

The contribution is the first blank and the impact is the second blank.

For example, Simon Sinek, the author of Start with Why, expresses his own WHY in these words: To inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, we can change our world. Simon's contribution is what he actively does for others (seeking to inspire them) and the impact is what happens when that contribution is made (a lot of people working together to change our world).
With that in mind, do what you can to find out what your companion is giving someone else or receiving in each story (the contribu-tion) and what difference it may have made to them or others the impact). You'll begin to see a pattern that will help you understand the contribution and impact of their WHY. There is almost always some sort of emotional cue, verbal or nonverbal, when they touch on one or both of these themes. P49/50
‚Ä¢ Avoid questions that start with "why." This may sound coun terintuitive, since you are doing a Why Discovery. But there's a problem with questions that start with "why." Ironically, they are actually harder to answer. "Why does that story matter to you?" for example, triggers the part of our brain that is not responsible for language. It's easier to answer a question that starts with "what." For example, "What is it about that story that really matters to you?" It's basically the same question but framed in a way that is easier for someone to answer. It answers the "why" question by allowing the person to talk more specifically about the components of the story that were meaningful. P51/52
The goal of the story-gathering exercise is to end up with at least five stories that you consider the most impactful of your life. The more stories you have, the easier it will be for your partner to detect the patterns and themes that will lead to your WHY. Remember that each story must be about a specific time, place or moment. The more specific you are, the more you'll feel an emotional connection to that memory. And it's this emotional connection that will lead to your WHY. P58
With your themes all in one place, take a couple of moments to look them over. In some cases, the theme will be in every story. However, your partner should be able to tie each theme back to at least two of the stories you told. Re-member, an idea becomes a theme because it reoccurs in at least two seemingly unconnected stories. P72
Ironically, asking a question that starts with "why" doesn't actually get us to the WHY. That's because the question
"why" is an emotional question, and it tends to elicit vague or reactive answers. In contrast, asking a "what" question elicits a more thoughtful and exact answer. Now ask the same question again, this time framed with "what": "What is it about me that made you choose to be friends with me?" This time your buddy may say something like, "I don't know. I care about you. I can trust you. We're into the same stuff. And we just get along really well!" That's a logical answer, but of course, those are the basic elements of almost any friendship. Continue to play the devil's ad-vocate, always framing your "why" questions with "what." For example, if you want to ask "why...," instead ask "what is it about..." Follow up with something like, "Great, you've just defined what it means to be a friend! But what is it about me in particular?" P77
Let's take it a step further. Our whole team shares that Nested WHY. However, we are also individuals in that nest. Each of us makes our own unique contribution to our collective WHY. So within the team, each of us has an individual WHY that's all our own. P88
a WHY is discovered, not cre-ated, and that the Why Discovery process is not aspirational.
Nor is it a branding or marketing exercise. Approaching the process that way would completely undermine every thing that makes a true WHY so compelling, The WHY is about who we are, not what we'd like the company to become someday. P98
The Why Discovery workshop has three main actions:

Set the context
Run the Why Discovery Process
Draft a Why Statement
P113
After you have been introduced and the floor is yours, we recommend you begin by sharing a short WHY story. Sharing a personal WHY experience can go a long way toward forging a bond with your audience. Whatever story you choose to tell, it should illuminate what's possible when a group of people are united in service to a higher purpose. It should also illustrate how a common WHY can inspire loyalty in a tribe. The story will function both as a real-life link to the reason for the session-to find the organization's WHY-and as evidence of the reward to be won by those who stay present and engage in the
process. P114/115
WHATs are products, services and job functions we perform.
HOWs are values, guiding principles and actions that make us stand out. 
The WHY defines what the organization stands for-it is the collective purpose, cause or belief.

It's human nature to go from what's easiest to understand to what's hardest to understand. In terms of the Golden Circle, most of us think, act and communicate from the outside in (WHAT-HOW-WHY Those with the capacity to inspire do it differently. They think, act and communicate from the inside out (WHY-HOW-WHAT). The WHAT corresponds to the neocortex, the "newest" part of our brain, which is responsible for rational, analytical thought and language. The WHY corresponds to the limbic brain, which is responsible for our feelings, such as trust and loyalty. This part of the brain drives all human behavior and decision making but has no capacity for language. This is how we are hardwired; it's biology, not psychology. People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it. When a company has a strong WHY, it inspires trust and loyalty in its customers, clients, employees and supporters, all of whom will cheer you on in your cause. P117/118
Sharing personal stories and identifying their themes are critical. pieces of the Why Discovery process for individuals and groups alike. P119
Tell specific stories of when you have felt most proud to work for this organization. P122

Generalizations are no good. You want stories about specific people and specific moments. The more specific, the better. "I'm proud of the quality of the work we do" is too general. "I was so proud the night 1 met a woman at a holiday party and she told me that her child's life had been saved by a cancer drug we developed.! don't even work in that division, but it reminded me of the importance of our work" is better because it's more specific and emotional. The outcome described in the stories can be big or small, affecting thousands of people or just one person. The important thing is for the story to cause a visceral, emotional response in the person telling it. P124


### Propaganda
- **Year Read**: 2024
- **Publication Date**: 1923
- **Author**: Edward Bernays

Lippmann had arrived at the bleak view that "the democratic El Dorado" is impossible in modern mass society, whose members‚Äîby and large incapable of lucid thought or clear perception, driven by herd instincts and mere prejudice, and frequently disoriented by external stimuli-were not equipped to make decisions or engage in rational discourse.
"Democracy" therefore requires a supra-governmental body of detached professionals to sift the data, think things through, and keep the national enterprise from blowing up or crashing to a halt. Although mankind surely can be taught to think, that educative process will be long and slow. In the meantime, the major issues must be framed, the crucial choices made, by "the responsible administrator." "It is on the men inside, working under conditions that are sound, that the daily administration of society must rest. P16
Always thinking far ahead, his aim was not to urge the buyer to demand the product now, but to transform the buyer's very world, so that the product must appear to be desirable as if without the prod of salesmanship. What is the prevailing custom, and how might that be changed to make this thing or that appear to recommend itself to people? "The modern propagandist... sets to work to create circumstances which will modify that custom." Bernays sold Mozart pianos, for example, not just by hyping the pianos. Rather, he sought carefully "to develop public acceptance of the idea of a music room in the home"-selling the pianos indirectly, through various suggestive trends and enterprises that make it de rigeur to have the proper space for a piano. 
The music room will be accepted because it has been made the thing. And the man or woman who has a music room, or has arranged a corner of the parlor as a musical corner, will naturally think of buying a piano. It will come to him as his own idea. P19/20
And yet those who do such work are also prone to lose touch with reality; for in their universe the truth is ultimately what the client wants the world to think is true. Whatever cause they serve or goods they sell, effective propagandists must believe in it‚Äîor at least momentarily believe that they believe in it. Even he or she who propagates commodities must be to some extent a true believer. "To advertise a product you must believe in it. To convince you must be convinced yourself," observes Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, longtime head of Publicis, the giant French ad agency. "*I guess I really believe all those schmaltzy things I say in the ads. It seems to have nothing to do with the hardheaded strategies I can work out for marketing products" admits Shirley Polykoff, Clairo's legendary adwoman ("Does she.... Or doesn't she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure!") P23
In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically rasting before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would be hopelesly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea. P39
Modern propaganda is a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of the public to an enterprise, idea or group. P52
Governments, whether they are monarchical, constitutional, democratic or communist, depend upon acquiescent public opinion for the success of their efforts and, in fact, government is government only by virtue of public acquiescence. Industries, public utilities, educational movements, indeed all groups representing any concept or product, whether they are majority or minority ideas, succeed only because of approving public opinion.
Public opinion is the unacknowledged partner in all broad efforts. P64
His first efforts are, naturally, devoted to analyzing his clients' problems, and making sure that what he has to offer the public is something which the public accepts or can be brought to accept. It is futile to attempt to sell an idea or to prepare the ground for a product that is basically unsound. P65
he nevertheless refuses a client whom he believes to be dishonest, a product which he believes to be fraudulent, or a cause which he believes to be antisocial.
One reason for this is that, even though a special pleader, he is not dissociated from the client in the public's mind.
Another reason is that while he is pleading before the court‚Äî the court of public opinion‚Äîhe is at the same time trying to affect that court's judgments and actions. In law, the judge and jury hold the deciding balance of power. In public opinion, the public relations counsel is judge and jury, because through his pleading of a case the public may accede his opinion and judgment.
He does not accept a client whose interests conflict with those of another client. He does not accept a client whose case he believes to be hopeless or whose product he believes to be unmarketable.
He should be candid in his dealings. It must be repeated that his business is not to fool or hoodwink the public.
If he were to get such a reputations, his usefulness in his profession would be at an end. When he is sending out propaganda material, it is clearly labeled as to the source. The editor knows from whom it comes and what its purpose is, and accepts or rejects it on its merits as news. P70
The modern propagandist studies systematically and objectively the material with which he is working in the spirit of the laboratory. If the matter in hand is a nationwide sales campaign, he studies the field by means of a clipping service, or of a corps of scouts, or by personal study at a crucial spot. He determines, for example, which features of a product are losing their public appeal, and in what new direction the public taste is veering. He will not fail to investigate to what extent it is the wife who has the final word in the choice of her husband's car, or of his suits and shirts. P72
Propaganda, like economics and sociology, can never be an exact science for the reason that its subject matter, like theirs, deals with human beings. P73
Trotter and Le Bon concluded that the group mind does not think in the strict sense of the word. In place of thoughts it has impulses, habits, and emotions. In making up its mind, its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology. P73
It is chiefly the psychologists of the school of Freud who have pointed out that many of man's thoughts and actions are compensatory substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to suppress. A thing may be desired not for its intrinsic worth or usefulness, but because he has unconsciously come to see in it a symbol of something else, the desire for which he is ashamed to admit to himself. A man buying a car may think he wants it for purposes of locomotion, whereas the fact may be that he would really prefer not to be burdened with it, and would rather walk for the sake of his health. He may really want it because it is a symbol of social position, an evidence of his success in business, or a means of pleasing his wife. P75
The new salesmanship has found it possible, by dealing with men in the mass through their group formations, to set up psychological and emotional currents which will work for him. Instead of assaulting sales resistance by direct attack, he is interested in removing sales resistance. He creates circumstances which will swing emotional currents so as to make for purchaser demand.
If, for instance, I want to sell pianos, it is not sufficient to
blanket the country with a direct appeal, such as:
"YOU buy a Mozart piano now. It is cheap. The best artists
use it. It will last for years."
The claims may all be true, but they are in direct conflict with the claims of other piano manufacturers, and in indirect competition with the claims of a radio or a motorcar, each competing for the consumer's dollar.
What are the true reasons the purchaser is planning to spend his money on a new car instead of on a new piano?
Because he has decided that he wants the commodity called locomotion more than he wants the commodity called music?
Not altogether. He buys a car because it is at the moment the group custom to buy cars.
The modern propagandist therefore sets to work to create circumstances which will modify that custom. He appeals perhaps to the home instinct which is fundamental.
He will endeavor to develop public acceptance of the idea of a music room in the home. This he may do, for example, by organizing an exhibition of period music rooms designed by well-known decorators who themselves exert an influence on the buying groups. He enhances the effectiveness and prestige of these rooms by putting in them rare and valuable tapestries. Then, in order to create dramatic interest in the exhibit, he stages an event or ceremony. To this ceremony key people, persons known to influence the buying habits of the public, such as a famous violinist, a popular artist, and a society leader, are invited. These key people affect other groups, lifting the idea of the music room to a place in the public consciousness which it did not have before. The juxtaposition of these leaders, and the idea which they are dramatizing, are then projected to the wider public through various publicity channels. Meanwhile, influential architects have been persuaded to make the music room an integral architectural part of their plans with perhaps a specially charming niche in one corner for the piano. Less influential architects will as a matter of course imitate what is done by the men whom they consider masters of their profession.
They in turn will implant the idea of the music room in the mind of the general public.
The music room will be accepted because it has been made the thing. And the man or woman who has a music room, or has arranged a corner of the parlor as a musical corner, will naturally think of buying a piano. It will come to him as his own idea.
Under the old salesmanship the manufacturer said to the prospective purchaser, "Please buy a piano." The new salesmanship has reversed the process and caused the prospective purchaser to say to the manufacturer, "Please sell me a piano.‚Äù P77/78/79
The great political problem in our modern democracy is how to induce our leaders to lead. The dogma that the voice of the people is the voice of God tends to make elected persons the will-less servants of their constituents. This is undoubtedly part cause of the political sterility of which certain American critics constantly complain.
No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and clich√©s and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders.
Fortunately, the sincere and gifted politician is able, by the instrument of propaganda, to mold and form the will of the people. P109
The emotions of oratory have been worn down through long years of overuse. Parades, mass meetings, and the like are successful when the public has a frenzied emotional interest in the event. The candidate who takes babies on his lap, and has his photograph taken, is doing a wise thing emotionally, if this act epitomizes a definite plank in his platform. Kissing babies, if it's worth anything, must be used as a symbol for a baby policy and it must be synchronized with a plank in the platform. But the haphazard staging of emotional events without regard to their value as part of the whole campaign, is a waste of effort, just as it would be a waste of effort for the manufacturer of hockey skates to advertise a picture of a church surrounded by spring foliage. It is true that the church appeals to our religious impulses and that everybody loves the spring, but these impulses do not help to sell the idea that hockey skates are amusing, helpful, or increase the general enjoyment of life for the buyer. P116
If I seem to concentrate on the accomplishments of women in politics, it is because they afford a particularly striking example of the intelligent use of the new propaganda to secure attention and acceptance of minority ideas. It is perhaps curiously appropriate that the latest recruits to the political arena should recognize and make use of the newest weapons of persuasion to offset any lack of experience with what is somewhat euphemistically termed practical politics.
As an example of this new technique: Some years ago, the Consumer's Committee of Women, fighting the "American valuation" tariff, rented an empty store on Fifty-Seventh Street in New York and set up an exhibit of merchandise, tagging each item with the current price and the price it would cost if the tariff went through. Hundreds of visitors to this store rallied to the cause of the committee. P131
If his institution does not produce the mental picture which it should, one of two things may be wrong: Either the media of communication with the public may be wrong or unbalanced; or his institution may be at fault. The public is getting an oblique impression of the university, in which case the impression should be modified; or it may be that the public is getting a correct impression, in which case, very possibly, the work of the university itself should be modified. For both possibilities lie within the province of the public relations counsel. P144
If the public is better informed about the processes of its life, it will be so much the more receptive to reasonable appeals to its own interests.
No matter how sophisticated, how cynical the public may become about publicity methods, it must respond to the basic appeals, because it will always need food, crave amusement, long for beauty, respond to leadership.
If the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands, commercial firms will meet the new standards. If it becomes weary of the old methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or commodity, its leaders will present their appeals more intelligently.
Propaganda will never die out. Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos. P168


### Fooled By Randomness
- **Year Read**: 2024

Psychologists have shown that most people prefer to make $70,000 when others around them are making $60,000 than to make $80,000 when others around them are making $90,000. P16
impressionist paintings, or the entrepreneur who collects private jets. For one cannot consider a profession without taking into account the average of the people who enter it, not the sample of those who have succeeded in it. P21 
The idea of taking into account both the observed and unobserved possible outcomes sounds like lunacy. For most people, probability is about what may happen in the future, not events in the observed past; an event that has already taken place has 100% probability, i.e., certainty. I have discussed the point with many people who platitudinously accuse me of confusing myth and re-ality. Myths, particularly well-aged ones, as we saw with Solon's warning, can be far more potent (and provide us with more experience) than plain reality. P21
I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision). P22
The reader can see my unusual notion of alternative account-ing: $10 million earned through Russian roulette does not have the same value as $10 million earned through the diligent and artful practice of dentistry. They are the same, can buy the same goods, except that one's dependence on randomness is greater than the other. To an accountant, though, they would be identical; to your next-door neighbor too. P24
Beware the spendthrift "businesswise" person; the cemetery of markets is disproportionately well stocked with the self-styled "bottom line" people. In contrast with their customary Masters of the Universe demeanor, they suddenly look pale, humble, and hormone-deprived on the way to the personnel office for the customary discussion of the severance agreement. P33
The market movements in the eighteen months after September 11, 2001, were far smaller than the ones that we faced in the eighteen months prior-but somehow in the mind of investors they were very volatile. The discussions in the media of the "ter-rorist threats" magnified the effect of these market moves in people's heads. This is one of the many reasons that journalism may be the greatest plague we face today‚Äîas the world becomes more and more complicated and our minds are trained for more and more simplification. P39
Monte Carlo simulations are closer to a toy than anything I have in my adult life. One can generate thousands, perhaps millions, of random sample paths, and look at the prevalent characteristics of some of their features. The assistance of the computer is instrumental in such studies. The glamorous reference to Monte Carlo indicates the metaphor of simulating the random events in the manner of a virtual casino. One sets conditions believed to resemble the ones that prevail in reality, and launches a collection of simulations around possible events. With no mathematical literacy we can launch a Monte Carlo simulation of an eighteen-year-old Christian Lebanese successively playing Russian roulette for a given sum, and see how many of these attempts result in enrichment, or how long it takes on average before he hits the obituary. We can change the barrel to contain 500 holes, a matter that would decrease the probability of death, and see the results. P46
A more vicious effect of such hindsight bias is that those who are very good at predicting the past will think of themselves as good at predicting the future, and feel confident about their ability to do so. This is why events like those of September 11, 2001, never teach us that we live in a world where important events are not predictable even the Twin Towers' collapse appears to have been predictable then. P56
1. Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns. In other words, one sees the variance, little else. I always remind myself that what one observes is at best a combination of variance and returns, not just returns (but my emotions do not care about what I tell myself).
1. Our emotions are not designed to understand the point. The dentist did better when he dealt with monthly statements rather than more frequent ones. Perhaps it would be even better for him if he limited himself to yearly statements. (If you think that you can control your emotions, think that some people also believe that they can control their heartbeat or hair growth.)
1. When I see an investor monitoring his portfolio with live prices on his cellular telephone or his handheld, I smile and smile. P67
Finally, this explains why people who look too closely at randomness bum out, their emotions drained by the series of pangs they experience. Regardless of what people claim, a negative pang is not offset by a positive one (some psychologists estimate the negative effect for an average loss to be up to 2.5 the magnitude of a positive one); it will lead to an emotional deficit. Now that you know that the high-frequency dentist has more exposure to both stress and positive pangs, and that these do not cancel out, consider that people in lab coats have examined some scary properties of this type of negative pangs on the neural system (the usual expected effect: high blood pressure; the less ex-pected: chronic stress leads to memory loss, lessening of brain plasticity, and brain damage). To my knowledge there are no stud-jes investigating the exact properties of trader's burnout, but a daily exposure to such high degrees of randomness without much control will have physiological effects on humans (nobody studied the effect of such exposure on the risk of cancer). What economists did not understand for a long time about positive and negative kicks is that both their biology and their intensity are different. Consider that they are mediated in different parts of the brain-and that the degree of rationality in decisions made subsequent to a gain is extremely different from the one after a loss. P68
Even the economists, who usually find completely abstruse ways to escape reality, are starting to understand that what makes us tick is not necessarily the calculating accountant in us. We do not need to be rational and scientific when it comes to the details of our daily life-only in those that can harm us and threaten our survival. Modern life seems to invite us to do the exact opposite; become extremely realistic and intellectual when it comes to such matters as religion and personal behavior, yet as irrational as possible when it comes to matters ruled by randomness (say, portfolio or real estate investments). I have encountered colleagues, "rational," no-nonsense people, who do not understand why I cherish the poetry of Baudelaire and Saint-John Perse or obscure (and often impene-trable) writers like Elias Canetti, J. L. Borges, or Walter Benjamin.
Yet they get sucked into listening to the "analyses" of a television "guru," or into buying the stock of a company they know absolutely nothing about, based on tips by neighbours who drive expensive cars. P77
And, at any point in time, the richest traders are often the worst traders This, I will call the cross-sectional problem: At a given time in the market, the most successful traders are likely to be those that are best fit to the latest cycle. This does not happen too often with dentists or pianists because these professions are more immune to randomness. P86
We will ignore the basic misuse of Darwinian ideas in the fact that organizations do not reproduce like living members of nature-Darwinian ideas are about reproductive fitness, not about survival. The problem comes, as everything else in this book, from randomness. Zoologists found that once randomness is injected into a system, the results can be quite surprising: What seems to be an evolution may be merely a diversion, and possibly regression. P94
Darwinian fitness applies to species developing over a very long time, not observed over a short term-time aggregation eliminates much of the effects of randomness; things (I read noise) balance out over the long run, as people say.
Owing to the abrupt rare events, we do not live in a world where things "converge" continuously toward betterment. Nor do things in life move continuously at all. P95
Recall that someone with only casual knowledge about the problems of randomness would believe that an animal is at the maximum fitness for the conditions of its time. This is not what evolution means; on av-erage, animals will be fit, but not every single one of them, and not at all times. Just as an animal could have survived because its sample path was lucky, the "best" operators in a given business can come from a subset of operators who survived because of overfit-ness to a sample path‚Äîa sample path that was free of the evolutionary rare event. One vicious attribute is that the longer these animals can go without encountering the rare event, the more vulnerable they will be to it. We said that should one extend time to infinity, then, by ergodicity, that event will happen with certainty‚Äî the species will be wiped out! For evolution means fitness to one and only one time series, not the average of all the possible environments. P96
Let us assume that the reader shared my opinion, that the market over the next week had a 70% probability of going up and 30% probability of going down. However, let us say that it would go up by 1% on average, while it could go down by an average of 10%.
What would the reader do? Is the reader bullish or bearish? P101
Accordingly, bullish or bearish are terms used by people who do not engage in practicing uncertainty, like the television commen-tators, or those who have no experience in handling risk. Alas, investors and businesses are not paid in probabilities; they are paid in dollars. Accordingly, it is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made when it happens that should be the consideration. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it is the magnitude of the outcome that counts. It is a pure accounting fact that, aside from the commentators, very few people take home a check linked to how often they are right or wrong. What they get is a profit or loss. As to the commentators, their success is linked to how often they are right or wrong. This category includes the "chief strategists" of major investment banks the public can see on
TV, who are nothing better than entertainers. They are famous, seem reasoned in their speech, plow you with numbers, but, func-tionally, they are there to entertain-for their predictions to have any validity they would need a statistical testing framework. Their frame is not the result of some elaborate test but rather the result of their presentation skills. P102
The best description of my lifelong business in the market is
"skewed bets," that is, I try to benefit from rare events, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly, present a large payoff when they occur. I try to make money in-frequently, as infrequently as possible, simply because I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price. In addition to my own empiricism, I think that the counterintuitive aspect of the trade (and the fact that our emotional wiring does not accommodate it) gives me some form of advantage. P103
On the surface, my statement here may seem to contradict earlier discussions, where I blame people for not learning enough from history. The problem is that we read too much into shallow recent history, with statements like "this has never happened be-fore," but not from history in general (things that never happened before in one area tend eventually to happen). In other words, history teaches us that things that never happened before do happen.
It can teach us a lot outside of the narrowly defined time series, the broader the look, the better the lesson. In other words, history teaches us to avoid the brand of naive empiricism that consists of learning from casual historical facts. P108
The very same effect takes place in the market. We take past history as a single homogeneous sample and believe that we have considerably increased our knowledge of the future from the observation of the sample of the past. What if vicious children were changing the composition of the urn? In other words, what if things have changed? P113
speculative portfolio turned a profit proves very little of anything. One cannot infer much from a single experiment in a random environment‚Äîan experiment needs a repeatability showing some causal component. P122
Memory in humans is a large machine to make inductive infer-ences. Think of memories: What is easier to remember, a collection of random facts glued together, or a story, something that offers a series of logical links? Causality is easier to commit to memory.
Our brain would have less work to do in order to retain the infor-mation. The size is smaller. What is induction exactly? Induction is going from plenty of particulars to the general. It is very handy, as the general takes much less room in one's memory than a collection of particulars. The effect of such compression is the reduction in the degree of detected randomness. P130

The major problem with inference in general is that those whose profession is to derive conclusions from data often fall into the trap faster and more confidently than others. The more data we have, the more likely we are to drown in it. For common wisdom among people with a budding knowledge of probability laws is to base their decision making on the following principle: It is very unlikely for someone to perform considerably well in a consistent fashion without his doing something right. Track records therefore become preeminent. They call on the rule of the likelihood of such a successful run and tell themselves that if someone performed better than the rest in the past then there is a great chance of his performing better than the crowd in the future-and a very great one at that. But, as usual, beware the middlebrow: A small knowledge of probability can lead to worse results than no knowledge at all. P135/136
A brief summing up at this point: I showed how we tend to mistake one realization among all possible random histories as the most representative one, forgetting that there may be others. In a nutshell, the survivorship bias implies that the highest performing realization will be the most visible. Why? Because the losers do not show up. P146
Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also be predictive of failure. Optimistic people certainly take more risks as they are overconfident about the odds; those who win show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear from the analyses. Sadly. P148
Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure. P156
The Mysterious Letter: You get an anonymous letter on January 2 informing you that the market will go up during the month. It proves to be true, but you disregard it owing to the well-known January effect (stocks have gone up historically during January). Then you receive another one on February 1 telling you that the market will go down. Again, it proves to be true. Then you get another letter on March 1-same story. By July you are intrigued by the prescience of the anonymous person and you are asked to invest in a special offshore fund. You pour all your savings into it. Two months later, your money is gone. You go spill your tears on your neighbor's shoulder and he tells you that he remembers that he received two such mysterious letters. But the mailings stopped at the second letter. He recalls that the first one was correct in its prediction, the other incorrect.
What happened? The trick is as follows. The con operator pulls 10,000 names out of a phone book. He mails a bullish letter to one half of the sample, and a bearish one to the other half.
The following month he selects the names of the persons to whom he mailed the letter whose prediction turned out to be right, that is, 5,000 names. The next month he does the same with the remaining 2,500 names, until the list narrows down to 500 people. Of these there will be 200 victims. An investment in a few thousand dollars' worth of postage stamps will turn into several million. P157/158
A programmer helped me build a backtester. It is a software program connected to a database of historical prices, which allows me to check the hypothetical past performance of any trading rule of average complexity. I can just apply a mechanical trading rule, like buy NASDAQ stocks if they close more than 1.83% above their average of the previous week, and immediately get an idea of its past per-formance. The screen will flash my hypothetical track record associated with the trading rule. If I do not like the results, I can change the percentage to, say, 1.2%. I can also make the rule more complex.
I will keep trying until I find something that works well.
What am I doing? The exact same task of looking for the survivor within the set of rules that can possibly work. I am fitting the rule on the data. This activity is called data snooping. The more ! try, the more I am likely, by mere luck, to find a rule that worked on past data. A random series will always present some detectable pattern. I am convinced that there exists a tradable security in the Western world that would be 100% correlated with the changes in temperature in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. P162
It is better to have a handful of enthusiastic advocates than hordes of people who appreciate your work-better to be loved by a dozen than liked by the hundreds. This applies to the sales of books, the spread of ideas, and success in general and runs counter to conventional logic. The information age is worsening this effect. This is making me, with my profound and antiquated Mediterranean sense of metron (measure), extremely uncomfortable, even queasy. Too much success is the enemy (think of the punishment meted out on the rich and famous); too much failure is demoralizing. I would like the option of having neither. P181
His idea is that if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy. Accordingly, there has to be in us an approximation process that stops somewhere. Clearly he got his intuitions from computer science he spent his entire career at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which has a reputation as a computer science center. "Satisficing" was his idea (the melding together of satisfy and suffice): You stop when you get a near-satisfactory solution. Otherwise it may take you an eternity to reach the smallest conclusion or perform the smallest act.
We are therefore rational, but in a limited way: "boundedly ra-tional." He believed that our brains were a large optimizing machine that had built-in rules to stop somewhere. P197
This brings to mind another common violation of probability by prime-time TV financial experts, who may be selected for their looks, their charisma, and their presentation skills, but certainly not for their incisive minds. For instance, a fallacy that I saw commonly made by a prominent TV financial guru goes as follows:
*The average American is expected to live seventy-three years.
Therefore if you are sixty-eight you can expect to live five more years, and should plan accordingly." She went into precise prescriptions of how the person should invest for a five-more-years horizon. Now what if you are eighty? Is your life expectancy minus seven years? What these journalists confuse is the unconditional and conditional life expectancy. At birth, your unconditional life expectancy may be seventy-three years. But as you advance in age and do not die, your life expectancy increases along with your life. Why? Because other people, by dying, have taken your spot in the statistics, for expectation means average. So if you are seventy-three and are in good health, you may still have, say, nine years in expectation. But the expectation would change, and at eighty-two, you will have another five years, provided of course you are still alive. Even someone one hundred years old still has a positive conditional life expectation. Such a statement, when one thinks about it, is not too different from the one that says: Our operation has a mortality rate of 1%. So far we have operated on ninety-nine patients with great success; you are our one hundredth, hence you have a 100% probability of dying on the table. P212/213
Significance: How did I decide that it was perfect noise? Take a simple analogy. If you engage in a mountain bicycle race with a friend across Siberia and, a month later, beat him by one single second, you clearly cannot quite boast that you are faster than him. You might have been helped by something, or it can be just plain randomness, nothing else. That second is not in itself significant enough for someone to draw conclusions. I would not write in my pre-bedtime diary: Cyclist A is better than cyclist B because he is fed with spinach whereas cyclist B has a diet rich in tofu. The reason I am making this inference is because he beat him by 1.3 seconds in a 3,000 mile race. Should the difference be one week, then I could start analyzing whether tofu is the reason, or if there are other factors. P214

Causality: There is another problem; even assuming statistical significance, one has to accept a cause and effect, meaning that the event in the market can be linked to the cause proffered. Post hoc ergo propter hoc (it is the consequence because it came after). Say hospital A delivered 52% boys and hospital B delivered the same year only 48%; would you try to give the explanation that you had a boy because it was delivered in hospital A? P214</div>
